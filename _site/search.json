    "text": "Mobility workouts are structured routines aimed at improving the range of motion, control, and flexibility of joints and muscles. Mobility exercises emphasise dynamic, active movements that enhance the functional use of joints and tissues in real-life or sport-specific scenarios.\n\nMobility and Functional Strength\nUltimate demands dynamic actions like pivoting, jumping, and lunging, which require both strength and flexibility. Regular mobility training improves joint health, promotes recovery, and ensures that strength gains translate into functional, game-ready movement. Incorporating dynamic stretches, yoga, and targeted mobility drills into your routine will help maintain balance, agility, and control on the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nMobility is an essential complement to strength and speed training. Building strong muscles is important, but without the ability to generate power across a full range of motion, you won’t fully translate your training into optimal on-field performance. Strength without mobility can lead to stiffness and limited movement patterns, while speed without mobility increases the likelihood of strains during quick directional changes or sprints. Stability and flexibility in the hips, shoulders and knees are especially important for ultimate players to perform complex on-field movements.\nMobility becomes increasingly important as we age. Over time, natural processes such as muscle tightness, joint stiffness, and a decline in flexibility can limit our range of motion and movement efficiency. Regular mobility work helps counteract these effects by keeping joints healthy, improving posture, and maintaining strength through a functional range of motion. Additionally, enhanced mobility supports better balance and coordination, reducing the likelihood of falls and related injuries. Staying mobile also preserves the ability to engage in physical activities and sports, contributing to overall quality of life and longevity.\n\n\nComponents of mobility workouts\n\nDynamic Stretching: Movements that take joints and muscles through their full range of motion. Examples include leg swings, arm circles, or walking lunges.\nJoint Articulation: Controlled, isolated movements that improve joint health and awareness, such as shoulder circles or controlled hip rotations.\nActive Flexibility: Exercises that combine strength and flexibility, like deep squats, where muscles stretch while under load.\nMyofascial Release: Techniques like foam rolling or using massage balls to relieve tension and improve tissue pliability.\nEnd-Range Strengthening: Strengthening exercises at the extreme ranges of motion to improve control, such as Jefferson curls or split squats.\nBalance and Proprioception: Activities that challenge stability and body awareness, such as single-leg deadlifts or stability ball exercises.\n\n\n\nGoals of mobility training\n\nEnhance joint flexibility and stability.\nImprove movement efficiency.\nReduce the risk of injuries.\nOptimise performance in strength, speed, and agility.  \n\n\n\nExample exercises\n\nWorld’s Greatest Stretch: Combines lunging, spinal rotation, and hamstring stretching in a single flow.\nThoracic Spine Rotations: To improve upper back flexibility and rotation for throwing mechanics.\nAnkle Dorsiflexion Stretch: Crucial for cutting and sprinting mechanics.\nCouch Stretch: Focuses on hip flexor mobility for better stride length and core stability.\n90/90 Hip Transitions: Opens up the hips and improves control over rotational movements.\n\n\n\nMore training?\nThe good thing about mobility training is that you can incorporate it into your existing regime:\n\nAdd a short mobility routine as a warm up / cool down at the gym\nIncorporate some mobility exercises into your strength workouts\nIncorporate exercises into your dynamic warmups before training and games\nUse mobility training as active recovery. It’s great to keep the body moving on those days where your muscles need some rest.\nYoga sessions are a great alternative if you want to try something different\n\n\n\nTest your mobility\nThe Functional Movement Screen (FMS) is a series of tests to evaluate movement patterns and identify imbalances or limitations. It can help you understand your body’s mobility and stability needs, and guide your training to address specific areas.\n\nFMS publication\nFMS test overview\n\n\n\nBuild your mobility routine\nBuild your own mobility routine that works for you. Think about what you want to maintain and what you want to improve. Start with something that takes around 5 - 10 minutes and is easy to learn, then add exercises from there. There are a lot of exercises and routines to choose from, but these should provide some inspiration.\nThe Nike Training Club app is free and includes many mobility workouts as well as strength, speed and at home workouts.\nThe Functional Movement Systems website has a lot of information on mobility and functional movement including a large library of exercises.\nThere are some great examples here and countless other useful videos on these channels:\n\n\n\nThe BodyWeight Warrior\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O90ZZd1WEQs\n25 minute full body mobility\n\n\nGMB Fitness\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG9qbvAN3gQ\n8 Hip mobility exercises\n\n\nLeanBeefPatty\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SotLyRb8XjE\n10 minute warm up Routine\n\n\nTravis Dodds Physio\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsKIDgcD540\nUltimate Frisbee activation\n\n\nTom Morrison\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMR5UOikE3k\n10 minute mobility routine\n\n\nRoger Frampton\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@roger.frampton/videos\nMobility, balance posture"

The aim was to develop strength, power and technique through Jan-May, be game ready for the summer and peak for Nationals and Euros at the end of the season.\nSome things to think about while creating your plan:\n\nPeriodisation allows progressive training. Build muscle strength, transition this into power and translate that power into on-field movements.\nFocus on specific aspects to maximise gains, rather than spreading yourself too thin.\nAllow appropriate recovery time between workouts to avoid overloading.\nMake a plan that you can stick to. This needs to be tailored to your own time, motivation and access to facilities.\nAvoid plateauing or burnout.\n\nSwitching up your routine keeps you energised, focused and motivated.\n\n\nIf you need assistance making a plan then please contact a coach!\n\n\n Task\n\nBuild your training plan for the upcoming season.\nStart by laying out key dates for the year ahead. Think about when you want to hit peak performance, then work backwards to create a plan.\n\nNeed to perform at trials? Make sure you’ve started running a few weeks in advance.\nWant to peak for Nationals and again for Euros? Maybe add in a mini off-season to recover and rebuild.\n\n\n\n\n\n Training Resources\n\nThe GU website has some resources to help you:\n\nOff-season strength training\nPre-season strength training\nGU track program (16 weeks)\n\nEndurance training\nPreparing for sprinting\n\nGU Speed, Agility, Quickness training (12 weeks)\nFocused throwing sessions"

    "title": "Endurance Training",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Endurance in sport refers to the ability of your body to sustain movement for an extended period of time. Building up our endurance allows us to train harder and for longer and really pays off in the latter stages of games and tournaments.\nIt has two main components: muscular endurance and cardiovascular endurance.\nLifting in the gym, we’re mostly developing our muscular endurance - the ability of muscles to continue to perform repeated contractions against resistance.\nFor the next stage of our off-season training, we’re focusing on our cardiovascular endurance - the ability of our heart and lungs to transport oxygen to our muscles.\nHere is the GU track programme we’re going to be working through:\nGlasgow Ultimate track sessions\nAim for two running sessions a week.\nEase yourself into it, and adjust what we suggest to make it the right fit for you.\nBefore moving on to specifics, it’s worth highlighting we’re not just training our bodies here, we’re also training our minds.\nEndurance training allows us to see what our bodies are actually capable of and to keep stretching that a little each time. We learn how to feel where our limits actually are and when we have more we can give.\nFor each time we squeeze out an extra 10% in training and don’t die, we have that in the memory bank to tell ourselves to keep going on the pitch.\n\nDeveloping endurance for ultimate\nWe want our movements when training to be similar to our movements during games to prepare our bodies for the demands of the sport.\nDuring a game we’ll walk, jog, run, sprint, stop, change direction, sprint again, jog, jump, dive etc. etc. We have periods on the pitch of intense movements, sometimes sustained, sometimes explosive, followed by periods of rest and recovery on the sideline.\nGoing for super long and slow runs can be helpful for developing a base level of endurance but doesn’t prepare our muscles, lungs and heart in the same way. Similarly, whilst rowing, cycling and swimming are great for developing fitness and endurance, they’re not recruiting the muscles we use in running, at least not in the same way.\nWe’ll benefit the most from running, as it trains endurance in the specific muscles and ranges of motion of our running strides.\nSimilarly, use workouts which incorporate periods of rest/recovery. Teaching your body to recover quickly is essential to Ultimate - using those few minutes on the sideline to get your heart rate back down and be ready to give 100% next time you take the field.\n\n\nTrack your progress\nTry using apps such as Strava to keep track of your progress - this will help you stay motivated as you see improvement in your distance and/or pace. Remember running performance can be more susceptible to variation due to running surface, weather, environment, etc. Try to run the same route every time to more clearly see any development.\n\n\nHow hard should it be?\nFor each running session, we’re looking to find a level of exertion that you work hard and are done in by the end, but could just have energy left for one more set.\n(For me, the second set is always the hardest. Push through it and keep moving, you’ll get used to it!)\n\n\nTreadmill vs outdoors\nBoth come with pros and cons.\n\nOutdoors is the ideal as we play outdoors.\n\nPRO: We train our minds and bodies to run effectively in various conditions that we will end up playing in throughout an outdoor season. Relies on you to keep yourself going - big gains in mental resilience. Outside! Fresh air!\nCON: Driving rain. Black ice. Uneven road surfaces.\n\nTreadmills are a good alternative if running outside isn’t a sensible option that day or if not using a treadmill means you won’t run at all.\n\nPRO: No rain/black ice! Can easily control and monitor your pacing. Consistent surface.\nCON: Possibly just staring at a wall the whole run. Less reliance on ourselves to keep going, the machine demands it, so slightly less gained in terms of mental resilience.\n\n\n\n\nNon-running alternatives\nIf you are carrying injuries which will be aggravated by running, please do proceed with caution.\nIt is great to train our bodies to cope with the stress put on it by running, as this is an unavoidable and integral part of our sport. But we don’t want to worsen injuries.\nPrioritise rehabbing your body to get back to running as soon as possible.\nIn the meantime, find an exercise which gets your heart rate up for a sustained period of time and doesn’t aggravate your injuries.\nCreate a workout which replicates the on/off pace patterns of our running workouts. Try:\n\nSwimtervals\nBiketervals\nRowintervals\nElliptervals\n\n\n\nTASK\n\nGet started! Start with Week 0/1 of the GU track programme.\nShare your running photos to encourage others to get moving too."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Developing throwing skills requires focused, intentional practice. Here are some ideas and resources for practicing your skills.\n\nFocused throwing sessions\nWe use the term “focused throwing” to refer to drills with a deliberate emphasis on throwing skill. Adding focused throwing sessions to your training regime will help to develop your skill repertoire. You can do these at high intensity with boots to get some cardio and agility in at the same time. Choose a few drills with 1 or 2 specific aims and find some people to throw with. Here are a few example sessions:\n\nGU focused throwing sessions\n\nPhase 1: Fundamentals\nPhase 2: Dynamics\nPhase 3: Range\n\nRowan McDonnell throwing sessions\n\nFocused throwing session\n30 min throwing session\n\nKung-fu throwing\n\nExplanation\nChecklist\nVideos\n\nZen throwing\n\nExplanation\nVideos\n\n\n\n\nAt Training\nThere is normally time to throw pre/post training or as part of the warm up. Think about how you can maximise this time (quality not quantity) by focusing your throwing and catching drills:\n\nChoose something specific to work on\nDecide if you need repetition to ingrain a skill or variation to develop the skill\nWork on the “perfect pass”\nEngage your brain throughout\nSet standards (e.g. aim for zero turnovers)\n\nThese reps add up to many hours over years of practice, so think what you might be missing out on by wasting this time. There is still definitely a place for more casual throwing, especially if it helps you to zone out for a bit or experiment with your technique.\n\n\nIndoor Season\nPlaying indoors is great for skill development and a good way to invest your off-season time.\n\nFewer variables (no wind, shorter throws) makes it easier to develop technique\nYou get a lot of touches in an indoor game\nGenerally less competitive, more license to give things a go\nIf you’re ever going to throw off-hand scoobers in matches, you should probably try it indoors first!\n\n\n\nPlan your throwing sessions\nGet the most out of your throwing sessions by planning in advance.\n\nHave specific goals or drills in mind\nWhat equipment do you need (discs, cones)?\nIf you are working on technique, watch a video or speak to a coach first\nDo you need to print a plan or load it to your phone?\nDo you need a tripod/camera setup?\nFind good throwing partners!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The off season is a great time to set goals for the upcoming year. Think about your main focus for the season and when you aim to be in peak form. Maybe you want to be ready to play your best at trials to make it onto a competitive squad. Perhaps you’re gearing up for the university season, club tournaments or world championships. \nThink about the type of player you want to be, or even the type of player you need to be for your team or to make the squad you are trying out for. Whatever your aims, think about how to achieve them, how well you will need to perform and what processes you need to follow to reach that performance level. It doesn’t matter if you’re aiming to be ultra-competitive or play socially, if you want to improve your game then setting well-defined goals can be a valuable exercise. We can split goals into two main categories:\n\nOutcomes (your why)\nThese are often the big picture goals, like “win a medal at worlds”, “make the GU O-line”,  “MVP at cone”. They are outcomes;  results of the processes we identify and the work we put in. They often include elements that are out of our control. We set these goals as these are the ones that motivate us, these are the achievements that mean something to us. However, it is not as simple as saying “I want” and expecting it to happen. Even smaller goals like “being a better thrower” or “winning this game” are just outcomes. Setting these goals keep us motivated and determined but doesn’t give us a process to succeed.\n\n\nProcesses (your how)\nProcess goals are under your control and the basic means of reaching the performance level required to achieve your desired outcome. These are the specific actions you take during your training and the work you put into improving an aspect of your game. You can “become a better cutter” by: \n\nFinding a gym routine that works on explosive power\nPractising agility and footwork drills to improve the speed of your turns\nPlaying different positions at training to work on your spatial awareness\n\n\n\nGoal setting is a process that starts with careful consideration of what you want to achieve and ends with the hard work required to actually do it. Along the way, your processes help to formulate well-defined steps that transcend the specifics of each goal. Here are some things to think about when formulating your goals:\n\n\nMotivation\nSet goals that motivate you and are important to your own identity. If something is hard then know why it is worth doing. There’s no way I would run hill sprints for fun but I do them every year because of the benefits I get on-field. Choose processes that are in some way enjoyable; that you aren’t likely to give up on when the work becomes difficult or monotonous. Find a pain you can maintain. Sometimes it’s useful to switch up your workouts to avoid mental or physical burnout e.g. try a new gym routine or switch an agility session for a game of squash…\n\n\nWork on strengths as well as weaknesses\nWe often set goals to improve the weaker parts of our game, but we are usually defined by our strengths. Most players are on top teams because they do one or two things extremely well rather than being great all-rounders. Think about your main strengths and keep improving them. \n\n\nSet SMART goals\nSpecific: The more specific your goal, the easier it is to define the processes to achieve it. Think about the difference between “becoming a better thrower” and “improving my forehand roll-curve hucks”.\nMeasurable: Set measurable targets to achieve the desired outcome. For instance, if you want to be the “fastest player on the team” find out how fast you will need to run. If you want to be a “reliable handler” set yourself an acceptable pass completion rate. Record your performances and reassess the goal as your season progresses to keep you on track.\nAchievable: Set goals that are challenging but achievable. Think about the next step on the ladder rather than immediately aiming for the top. If your goals are unrealistic it is easy to become demoralised and lose confidence. Sometimes it’s good to set yourself limits and define what minimal success would look like as well as your ideal outcome.\nRelevant: Make sure your goals align with long-term objectives. Does your gym goal actually translate to improvement as an ultimate player?\nTime-based: Give your goals reasonably short deadlines to increase your productivity, keep yourself accountable and avoid plateauing.\n\n\n\n\nCommit your goals to writing\nThe physical act of writing down a goal makes it real and tangible. You may decide to write a full action plan or just a few statements. It’s a good idea to remind yourself of your goals and review them throughout the season. Some things that might work for you:\n\nKeep a notebook to track your goals. Bring it to training so you can easily review or keep a diary of your performance.\nWrite it on your hand. Sometimes I write 1 or 2 things on my hand before a training session that I want to focus on that day and remind myself during the session.\n\n\n\nShare your goals\nDeciding to share your goals with others can help to keep you accountable and provide external motivation. You could post them to the world on social media or just tell a friend, family member, teammate or coach.\n\n\nSelf analysis\nIf you are finding it hard to set goals, maybe start by writing down your strengths and weaknesses. Another idea is to describe the player you currently are and then the player you would like to be. It’s a good idea to discuss this with a coach, mentor or fellow player to make sure you are setting valuable goals and know how to achieve them. Your goals can be as big or small as you like and may be based around your gameplay, throwing ability, strength, speed, whatever you want to improve.\n\n\n Task\n\n\nThink about your strengths and weaknesses, what type of player are you and who do you want to be?\nThink about a few outcome goals e.g.\n\nA big picture goal for the upcoming season\nAn achievable goal for the off season\nA goal for the next training session you attend\n\nBreak one of these down into a few actionable processes\n\nWhat additional training can I do?\nWhat assistance do I need?\n\nThink of a way to measure the performance of one of your goals, set achievable targets and deadlines.\n\n\n\n\nPlan - Do - Review\nIt’s up to you how much effort you want to put into this, but do it in a way that makes sense to you. You could write a full on action plan (spreadsheet, flow diagrams, bullet points, mission statement) or just write a few things down on paper. It would be a good idea to make this accessible and visible e.g. Pin it up in your room, have a copy on your phone, bring notes to training\nThe point of this exercise is to make sure you are starting your off-season with a focus and have put some thought into how you will improve your game. Your goals will likely change throughout the season and it is important to review and reassess them regularly. Your long term “big picture” goals might stay the same but you will likely shift the focus of how you achieve them as your training progresses. Some goals may be as short term as the next training session.You don’t need to draw out a new action plan every time, just try to make a few notes and break down the processes and performances you require to achieve success."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Improving your throwing skills requires focused, dedicated practice. Whether you are warming up for training or taking part in a dedicated skills session, make sure you are getting optimal benefit from your reps. Here are some tips for getting the most out of your throwing drills\nTechnique first:\nNail the technique first, before you add defense, before you try to throw hard, before you over complicate your drills, get the technique down. Get feedback from a coach, teammate or videoanalysis.\nRepetition:\nBy repeating a similar task multiple times we develop muscle memory. Making multiple throws in quick succession allows us to replicate good technique and correct poor form. Drilling with a constant supply of discs is ideal when working on technique. Be sure to rest regularly to avoid loss of form through lack of focus or fatigue.\nAdd variation:\nOnce your technique is sound, play around with varying certain elements of your drills to develop your skills. \nBe specific: It’s not just a backhand. Be specific about the perfect pass, the shape of the throw, the game scenario and the target you want to hit.\nVisualise - Execute - Evaluate:\nVisualise a specific throw. Execute without overthinking. Evaluate the result.\nDon’t overthink it:\nConsciously thinking about individual body parts can be distracting and overwhelming. Give yourself feedback with verbs and adverbs: “Faster, more flick, smoother, pivot wider etc”  \nVisualise game scenarios:\nImagine a situation where you would use the throw you are drilling in a game. Visualise the direction of play, the sideline, your team mates, defender positioning etc. This will help you to maintain focus in drills and apply the skills during play. \nExaggeration:\nExaggerating skills can be a useful method to gain control and range of technique. For instance, if you naturally tend to throw with roll-curve and can’t get the hang of inside-out, try throwing high, loopy, sharp IO angled backhands to begin with.\nUse your time effectively:\nIf you think 90% of your on field throws will be forehand or backhand then spend the most time perfecting these throws.\nResearch and development:\nDevote some time to working on new throws or changes in technique. Keep working on technique in your throwing sessions until you are comfortable to use it in drills. You’ll then find it will naturally creep into your game. It’s also fun to play around with some new throws at the end of a session to wind down.\nCatching practice:\nThrowing drills are generally catching drills as well, don’t be lazy with your catching technique.\nThrow to targets:\nWhether it’s a set of cones or a receiver, give yourself a small target to aim for. Receivers can raise their hands as targets to improve accuracy, think about where you want the player to catch the disc (left side, chest, right side, high). Passes in matches often have a large margin for error as we are throwing to running receivers that can change their speed and direction. Developing accuracy therefore requires deliberate and focussed throwing practice.\n\nUse props:\nTrees and cones can make good targets (disc golf) and good forces to throw around.\nMaintain focus and intensity:\nDon’t let a dropped disc disturb the pace of a drill.\nThrow when it’s windy:\nThe wind offers resistance and highlights flaws in your technique. If you can learn to throw in the wind you’ll be amazed at what you can do on a still day. As well as throwing through the wind, learn to use it to get your disc to the intended target.\nRotate your drills:\nChange up the wind direction and learn to throw in different winds.\nThrow to moving targets:\nIn games we throw to moving targets more often than stationary ones. Think about the types of cuts you would make in a game.\nPractice moving into a throw:\nIn games we often receive the disc from one direction, then turn and throw in another direction. We also receive the disc on the move. Try to replicate these movements in some of your drills.\n3 &gt; 2:\nThrowing in pairs is fine and will give you lots of reps, but a 3rd person can add defense, continuation throws or multiple throwing options to your drills, making them more game-like. \nUse multiple discs:\nIncrease your reps and time between reps by using a stack of discs or having multiple discs in the air at once. \nPlay defense:\nPlay defense at a challenging level for the offense players so they get the most out of drills.\nReactive or random drills:\nAdd a reactive or random element to drills to force the thrower to think and execute quickly. \nVersatility:\nGood throwers have many tools at their disposal and can use multiple throws in the same situation. Use different throws in drills to hit the same targets.\nPlay small sided games:\nSmall sided games are a great way to get lots of realistic, randomised throwing reps. Make sure you have a focus and think about applying conditions or scenarios to the game to aid your learning.\nChallenge yourself:\nImprove by working at the limits of your ability and trying to push beyond. If you are throwing long, set a cone to aim for that is just beyond a comfortable distance for you. If you are working on wide pivots try this drill.\nBe okay with making mistakes:\nDeliberate practice occurs outside of your comfort zone. It should be difficult, don’t beat yourself up when you make errors. Try to find a state of relaxed concentration.\nScale the difficulty:\nIf a drill is too difficult for you to complete then think of ways to scale down the difficulty. Remove one of the variables or ask the defense to be less active. \nConsistency:\nConsistency and accuracy should be a prime focus. Skill development isn’t all about new techniques and throwing further. Consistently executing the throws you already have will make you an effective and reliable player. This is especially important in the lead up to tournaments where you want to feel confident hitting low risk options.\nTake a break:\nFocused, deliberate practice can be physically and mentally draining. When your concentration or form dips, take a break. Increasing your focused time over multiple sessions can help build your mental toughness.\nCross training:\nA lot of athletic and coordination skills are transferable across sports. Don’t feel like you always need to play ultimate to work on your skills."

Most experienced players also have a long way to go to master their skills and consistency.

Any sort of skill requires hours of practice to master technique, develop control and gain experience (memories) that you can draw on at will.\nThis guide mostly focuses on throwing and catching skills, but it is important to remember that running, turning, jumping, diving, forcing, defensive footwork and other game movements are also skills that need to be practiced and learned.\n\nRepetition and muscle memory\nSkill development is a brain-to-muscle activity. When learning a skill, the initial focus should be on technique, repetition and breaking the skill down into core components. For instance, when learning to throw a forehand, you could focus on the following:\n\nFootwork: Set your stance and get into a balanced pivot\nGrip: Check your grip is correct and the disc is held in the correct position\nRelease action: Use a “whipping” motion to spin the disc \nFollow through: Maintain balance and “finish forward” with your throwing action \n\nYou then want to throw hundreds or even thousands of forehands, focussing on technique and making small adjustments until you can execute the throw consistently. Eventually the skill becomes a more fluid motion as muscle memory is created and the task moves from a focussed conscious effort towards subconscious execution. \nFocusing on good technique is critical, otherwise you ingrain bad habits that are hard to unlearn. Consider getting help from a coach, a teammate or videoing your throws to analyse later.\n\n\nDeveloping adaptable skills\nOnce you have good technique, you can develop a skill by adding variation, the sooner the better:\n\nDistance to receiver\nPivot and release points\nMoving receivers to work on timing\nThrowing shape (flat, curved etc)\n\nBefore releasing a disc, your brain has to process a lot of information very quickly. It makes instinctive approximations about speed, angles, distance, height etc. Those approximations are all based on combinations of past experiences and are refined through hours of training. Your brain is a prediction machine. It is constantly taking in information from the outside world and using past information to try to predict the future. Similar to machine learning algorithms, the accuracy of these prediction models depend on having many, many data points and a dataset that accurately represents variation within the system. \nBasically, experience counts. Add variation to your drills to develop your skill and become an adaptable thrower. You can’t drill every possible combination, but you can add enough variation for your brain to accurately fill in the gaps when faced with new scenarios.\nExample:\nChanging the target distance every 10 throws can be better practice than 100 throws at a fixed distance.\nOne trademark of veteran throwers is the ability to perform micro-corrections mid way through the throwing action to adjust for imbalances in form. You might recognise the situation where your technique feels awful but you somehow get the disc to go where you wanted. This is often a sign that your brain is correcting your actions in real time to adjust for slight changes in technique. \n\n\nMastering game time skills\n\n“My hucks are decent but I never throw them in games”\n- Most developing players\n\nIt is important to realise the difference between being a good thrower and being a good passer. There are many pro disc golfers and freestylers that have undeniable skills with a disc but can’t play Ultimate at a high level. \nIn our sport there are multiple moving receivers and defenders that are constantly changing position and affecting the types of throws required to hit the available targets. You have to process a lot of dynamic information on the fly and also consider the weather, the dimensions of the pitch, your field position and a distracting force trying to point-block or foul you! Drills with minimal additional variables can be good for technique and development, but to get your throws game ready you must practise them in specific scenarios that replicate game like conditions.\nThese types of drills improve your capacity to control and adjust throws, increase spatial awareness and heighten your ability to anticipate play. They require a certain level of technique but are hugely beneficial in training your brain to see a scenario in front of you, select a throwing option and execute the required skill.\nWhenever you receive the disc, you are faced with a scenario you have never seen before. You may have had many similar experiences but nothing identical. Subconsciously, you call on a collection of past experiences, assess the information in front of you, and make a quick decision about the pass you want to attempt. It’s then up to your muscle memory to execute the movements required to perform the envisaged throw, a product of training and learning your technique.\nTraining these game time decisions is crucial to implementing your skills in games and being able to call on the right throw at the right time. You can do this by:\n\nRunning game like drills\n\nInclude defense, add sidelines, multiple throwing options and targets\n\nReactive drills\n\nDrills where things can change every rep \n\ne.g. forcing direction, cutting patterns, different receiver, different throw\n\n\nSmall sided games\n\nGreat for getting lots of touches in different situations\n\n\n\n\nVisualisation\n\nVisualise, execute, evaluate\nVisualisation is a powerful tool for developing throws with deliberate practice.  \n\nVisualise the specific throw you want to make\nExecute without thinking too much, just try to produce the desired outcome\nEvaluate the outcome:\n\nDid the result match your intention? \n\nDid the movements feel right?\nDid you maintain balance throughout the throw?\nDid you get enough snap on release?\n\nWhat adjustments do you need to make?  \n\n\nOne useful drill is to throw two discs in quick succession. With the second throw, to try to either  a) replicate a well executed first throw or b) correct the errors in the first throw. \n\n\nVisualise game like scenarios\nEven if you are only practicing with one other player, you can still imagine game-like scenarios and the throw you wish to execute. Imagine where you are on the pitch, what the defense is doing and the type of throw you want to make. \n\n\nBrain training\nAway from the pitch, putting yourself in game situations in your head, or replaying past scenarios is still valuable brain training. \n\n\n\nPerfect Passing\nFootball coaches use the phrase “perfect passing” to describe the thought process required when moving the ball. A pass is not simply kicking the ball, or throwing the disc to a player on your team. Some of the things to think about when making the perfect pass:\n\nThe target: \n\nIs it a pass directly to a player or out into space?\nAre we aiming for the players chest, their outstretched hand or the space above them?\n\nThrowing shape:\n\nFlat, roll curve, IO…\nWhat throwing shape evades defenders and fades towards the receiver?\n\nSpeed of the pass:\n\nHow fast does the disc need to go to be catchable at the target?\nDoes it need front edge or extra spin to float in space?\n\nTiming of release:\n\nWhen should the pass be released to hit the receiver in full flow?\n\nDefense and sidelines\n\nWhat pivot, throw, release point do I need to beat the force?\nWhich defenders are in positions to block the intended throw?\nWhat margin of error is there with sidelines and defense positioning?\n\nWeather conditions\n\nHow will the wind affect this throw? Do I need to adjust the angle, spin, speed etc?\n\n\nAll of the calculations above are performed with split-second timing (often subconsciously) with two aims in mind:\n\nCompleting a successful, catchable pass\nThe receivers next move i.e. continuation\n\nExample:\nPass: Throw to my reset \nPerfect pass: Pivot low and wide around the force. Throw a leading pass backhand into the space just beyond my receiver’s right shoulder. Raise the front edge to allow the disc to float in front of them and a touch of roll curve so that the disc bends towards the receiver’s path. This will give the receiver the best opportunity to continue the swing across the field.\nWhen running drills or practicing your throwing, you should think about the “perfect pass” for each situation and intentionally focus on specific aspects of the throw."
