    "text": "Self Improvement\n\nWatch others\nWe can learn a lot from the skills already present in those around us. If there is a particular skill you would like to improve, find a teammate that does it well and spend some time with them. Throw with them, partner up in drills, take a few mental notes and ask them questions. Observe their technique, try to mimic their movements while being aware of your own.\nIf you don’t have any real life role models, use the internet. There are hundreds of filmed games and coaching channels available (see below). Find a player that inspires you and watch them play the game. Find a skill that you want to develop, watch a coaching video and note down a couple of points to focus on at your next practice session.\n\n\nWatch yourself\nWatching yourself on film can be uncomfortable. Sometimes there is initial disbelief: Do I really run like that? Is that really how I throw? This is completely normal; our self-perceptions often differ from reality. However, getting to know your on-screen self will allow you to help that player develop. We also tend to be overly critical of ourselves, again a natural reaction. We are more likely to perceive our own differences as flaws and we notice our own mistakes more than anyone else.\nGetting to know yourself on-screen will help you better understand the player you are and the player your team perceives you to be. Video footage can help you to track your own progress and development. It can reveal weaknesses in our form, play or decision-making which you might not notice otherwise, allowing you to tailor your training to address these.\nThere’s also valuable perspective to be gained by watching matches again from a different vantage point and with distanced emotions. Research shows that on average, athletes and coaches only recall ~30% of performance correctly. Watching games back gives us a more rounded view of our performance and also a more objective standpoint.\nPerspective and feedback from coaches is invaluable. However, keeping track of a whole team means their attention cannot be focused on one individual throughout a training session or match. Remember, you are your best coach. Use footage to review your own performance in depth. If you speak to your coach about specific aspects of your game they may be willing to review footage to give more detailed and personalised feedback.\n\n\nImprove your technique\nFilm your drills, sprints, lifts and throwing. You don’t need to film every session, just every now and then to check in on your form, or if there is a particular skill component that you are trying to address. There are slow motion apps which allow you to break down your technique frame-by-frame for in-depth analysis.\n\nUse footage to adjust your next rep.\nAsk a coach to have a look at the footage and get feedback.\nCompare your technique with other athletes.\nFocus on changes in your technique and how this affects the outcome.\n\n\n\nImprove your performance in games\nThere is a lot to be gained from watching your own games and analysing your performance. Again, you are likely to be the only person who will do this with a sole focus on you.\n\nAnalyse your turnovers and near-turnovers\n\nWere the errors due to execution, decision making, concentration or luck?\nAre there any recurring patterns? e.g. not pivoting fully, always trying to catch with the same hand etc.\nDo they occur in specific scenarios? e.g. when stuck on a sideline, when there’s pressure on the catch etc.\nAre your teammates doing things you don’t expect?\nAre you doing things your teammates don’t expect?\n\n\n\nDon’t be overly critical\n\nIt’s easy to focus on the mistakes at the end of a possession but try to remember all the good stuff that went before.\n\n\n\nFind your highlight reel\n\nIt’s important to pick out the good stuff too.\n\n\n\nDon’t forget the boring stuff\n\nAre you good at making space for teammates.\nDo you set up in good positions.\nAre you timing your continuation cuts well.\nHow is your defensive positioning and communication.\n\n\n\nVisualise alternatives\n\nPick a few scenarios and think about what you could do differently\n\nCut laterally to clear a clogged lane and look for a break throw.\nCall a switch with a teammate to prevent an easy pull play score.\n\n\n\n\nReflect and act\n\nYou should come away from watching a game with a few general thoughts and an actionable plan to improve your game\nReflection\n\nHas the game solidified your belief in your strengths and weaknesses?\nWhat do you do well for your team? What could you do better?\nUse video analysis to build a picture of who you are as a player.\n\nAction points\n\nPick 1 or 2 things from your performance to specifically improve."

    "text": "Watching Ultimate Games\nSo much can be learned by watching others play the game, especially those that do it well. Watching other teams play live or on-screen can improve your game knowledge, make you aware of new strategies and provide inspiration for yourself and your team.\n\nVideo analysis is now commonplace in competitive sports and a lot can be gained by viewing games with an analytical mindset.\n\nTips for watching games analytically\nTake in the full picture. Think about tactics, choices and teamwork.\n\nWatch the players off the disc\n\nHow do they create space for themselves and teammates?\nWhen do they time their cut?\nHow do they shake or surprise defenders?\nWhat are defenders doing against inactive cutters?\nWatch entire possessions to see how play develops\n\nWhat were the key passes/cuts that opened up space to attack?\nWhich decisions led to the opportunity to get a block? Find a smart block then rewind to watch the build up.\n\n\n\n\nThink about tactics\n\nTry to spot set plays, different structures, the types of zones being used etc. This will help you become more aware in games.\nWhat is the forcing strategy? How are other defenders setting up?\n\n\n\nFind role models\n\nWatch players that play similar roles to you.\n\nAnalyse how they play those positions, the way they move and the decisions they make.\n\n\n\n\nWatch recorded matches\n\nYou’ll get more out of your time if you can skip through all of the dead time in a match.\nRewind function is crucial for analysing plays.\nUse the keyboard shortcuts “,” and “.” to go frame-by-frame for close calls and studying technique. The arrow keys can skip 10s at a time.\n\n\n\n\nHighlight reels\nHighlight reels are great for inspiration, motivation and showcasing our sport. However, the best highlight plays tend to be the product of throwing or decision errors that allow a defender to bid or require a receiver to make a play. Good offence is often quite boring but there is so much to be learned from teams that keep the disc well, create space on the field and run good plays.\n\n\nTips for analysing your own team\nAnalysing your team’s performance can help you to improve your own game. You may find better ways to integrate with the team’s style or identify weaknesses where you could better support your team.\nProviding critical analysis for teammates can be a touchy subject. Think about your role on the team (are you a captain or coach), how the process may affect teammates and what the best channels are to deliver feedback.\nIdeally you want to pick up on a few specific things that your team could improve as a whole. It’s best to focus on errors that commonly occur rather than highlighting every specific error each individual makes.\nEven better, find examples of other teams executing a technique, tactic or play perfectly to illustrate to your team.\nIf you can, watch games together. Start productive communication and get your teammates perspectives on certain scenarios. Getting all of your players to buy into strategy and playing style creates a solid team identity.\n\n\nTips for scouting other teams\nIt’s useful to build a short profile on opposition teams or players that you will match up against. The information you record should be concise, easy to digest just before a match and focus on things you can actually use to your advantage.\n\nIdentify their preferred offensive structure\n\nIs this the same for O and D lines?\n\nIdentify set plays and the initial “tells” that would allow you to recognise these in a game.\nIdentify their defensive strategies and zone setups\n\nWhere are the spaces to attack?\nHow do we “beat” this strategy?\n\nIdentify key players and match ups\n\nWhich players usually pick up the disc or are the main throwing threats?\nWhich players are the preferred first cutters or deep options?\nWhich defenders get poach blocks?\n\nIs it better to keep them away from the disc or out of the deep spaces?\n\nWhich players can we exploit with a mismatch?\n\nIdentify the players you are going to mark\n\nWhat are their preferred moves?\nWhere do they release most of their throws?\nWhere do they look uncomfortable on the pitch?\nWhat are their defensive strengths and weaknesses?\n\n\n\n\nRecording statistics\nData analysis has huge potential and is starting to revolutionise the way other sports are played. Statistics can be extremely valuable to teams and individuals if the correct information and crucially, ENOUGH information, is recorded. We won’t delve into it here, but it’s critical to realise that statistics can be wildly misleading without enough data points and the correct application."

If you suspect you may have a concussion, you should stop playing immediately and seek medical advice. Your teammates and coaches have a responsibility to make sure no one plays on with a suspected concussion. “If in doubt, sit them out”.\nMinor injuries can normally be self-treated with rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE), especially in the first 48 hours.\nFor more serious injuries, or if pain persists, you should see a doctor or physiotherapist.

It’s important to stay positive and use the opportunity to come back stronger. Not being able to play may allow you to spend more time on your strength work or throwing. If you can’t perform any physical activity, then perhaps you can gain some experience coaching or analysing games.\nWhen returning from injury, scale your training back up slowly.

    "text": "Mobility and Functional Strength\nUltimate demands dynamic actions like pivoting, jumping, and lunging, which require both strength and flexibility. Regular mobility training improves joint health, promotes recovery, and ensures that strength gains translate into functional, game-ready movement. Incorporating dynamic stretches, yoga, and targeted mobility drills into your routine will help maintain balance, agility, and control on the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nMobility is an essential complement to strength and speed training. Building strong muscles is important, but without the ability to generate power across a full range of motion, you won’t fully translate your training into optimal on-field performance. Strength without mobility can lead to stiffness and limited movement patterns, while speed without mobility increases the likelihood of strains during quick directional changes or sprints. Stability and flexibility in the hips, shoulders and knees are especially important for ultimate players to perform complex on-field movements.\nMobility becomes increasingly important as we age. Over time, natural processes such as muscle tightness, joint stiffness, and a decline in flexibility can limit our range of motion and movement efficiency. Regular mobility work helps counteract these effects by keeping joints healthy, improving posture, and maintaining strength through a functional range of motion. Additionally, enhanced mobility supports better balance and coordination, reducing the likelihood of falls and related injuries. Staying mobile also preserves the ability to engage in physical activities and sports, contributing to overall quality of life and longevity."

Dehydration can lead to fatigue, muscle cramps, reduced coordination, and even cognitive decline—all of which can negatively impact your game.\n\n1. Daily Hydration Needs\nYour hydration needs depend on your body size, activity level, and climate. However, general guidelines suggest ~2.7 - 3.7 litres of water per day. Higher intake may be required by athletes, especially on training or competition days.\nAround 20% of water will come from food, the rest is provided by drinking drinking water and other fluids like milk, juice, tea/coffee, soup/stew etc.\nA good rule of thumb is to monitor urine color—pale yellow indicates good hydration, while dark yellow suggests dehydration.\n\n\n2. Hydration During Training and Matches\n\nBefore Activity\n\n1-2 hours before: Drink 500-600 ml  of water.\n30 minutes before: Drink 250-350 ml of water.\n\n\n\nDuring Activity\n\nFor sessions under 60 minutes, sip water (~100-200 ml every 15-20 minutes).\nFor sessions longer than 60 minutes, especially in hot weather, electrolyte-rich drinks can help replenish lost sodium, potassium, and magnesium.\n\n\n\nAfter Activity\n\nDrink 500-750 ml per 0.5 Kg lost through sweat.\nInclude electrolytes in recovery drinks (sports drinks, coconut water, or water with a pinch of salt).\n\n\n\nSigns of Dehydration\n\nFatigue, headaches, dizziness\nDry mouth, reduced urine output\nMuscle cramps\nIncreased heart rate\n\n\n\nOverhydration\nDrinking excessive amounts of water without replenishing electrolytes can lead to hyponatremia (low sodium levels), which can be dangerous.

    "text": "Protein\n\n1. Why Is Protein Important?\nProtein plays several key roles in athletic performance:\n\nMuscle repair and growth – especially after intense training or matches.\nRecovery – speeds up muscle repair and reduces soreness.\nProvides sustained energy – prevents muscle breakdown when glycogen stores are low.\nSupports immune function – reducing the risk of illness during the season.\n\n\n\n2. How Much Protein Do You Need?\nProtein needs vary based on training intensity and body weight:\n\nGeneral population: ~0.8g per kg of body weight.\nActive athletes: ~1.2-2.0g per kg of body weight.\nStrength-focused athletes: Up to 2.2g per kg for muscle gain.\n\n\nExample\nA 70 kg (154 lb) ultimate athlete should aim for 84-140g of protein per day depending on training demands.\n\n\n\n3. When to Consume Protein?\n\nPre-Exercise (1-2 hours before)\n\nA small amount of protein can help sustain muscle function.\nCombine with carbohydrates for energy.\nExamples:\n\nGreek yoghurt with fruit\nScrambled eggs on whole grain toast\nA protein smoothie with oats and banana\n\n\n\n\nPost-Exercise (Within 30-60 minutes after play)\n\nMost important window for muscle repair and growth.\nCombine protein and carbohydrates to replenish glycogen and start muscle recovery.\nExamples:\n\nProtein shake with banana\nGrilled chicken and quinoa\nCottage cheese with honey and berries\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Best Protein Sources for Ultimate Athletes\n\nAnimal-Based Sources (Complete Proteins – contain all essential amino acids)\n\nLean meats: Chicken, turkey, lean beef\nFish: Salmon, tuna, cod\nDairy: Greek yoghurt, cottage cheese, milk\nEggs: Whole eggs and egg whites\nWhey Protein: Fast-digesting, ideal post-workout\n\n\n\nPlant-Based Sources (May need to combine for a full amino acid profile)\n\nLegumes: Lentils, chickpeas, black beans\nSoy Products: Tofu, tempeh, edamame\nWhole Grains: Quinoa, oats, brown rice\nNuts & Seeds: Almonds, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds\nPlant-Based Protein Powders: Pea, hemp, rice protein\n\n\n\n\n5. Protein Supplements\nProtein powders are convenient but not required if you’re meeting your daily needs through whole foods.\n\nWhey protein (fast-digesting, ideal for post-workout recovery).\nCasein protein (slow-digesting, good for nighttime recovery).\nPlant-based proteins (pea, hemp, soy) for those avoiding dairy.\n\nIf using supplements, choose high-quality products without unnecessary additives or artificial sweeteners.\n\n\n6. Can You Eat Too Much Protein?\nExcess protein won’t necessarily boost performance and can lead to:\n\nUnused protein being stored as fat.\nIncreased strain on kidneys (for those with existing kidney conditions).\nImbalanced macronutrient intake (too much protein might mean too few carbs).\n\nAim for a balanced approach, focusing on timing and quality over excessive intake."

They provide quick and sustained energy, help with recovery, and prevent fatigue during long training sessions and tournaments.\n\n1. Why Are Carbohydrates Important?\n\nEnergy production: The body converts carbs into glycogen, which is stored in muscles and the liver for quick energy.\nImproved endurance: Helps maintain performance over multiple games or training sessions.\nFaster recovery: Restores glycogen stores after exercise.\nPrevents muscle breakdown: Ensures protein is used for muscle repair rather than energy.\n\n\n\n2. How Many Carbs Do You Need?\nCarbohydrate needs depend on training intensity:\n\nLow activity (rest day): ~3-5g per kg of body weight.\nModerate training (gym, skills practice): ~5-7g per kg.\nHigh-intensity training (game days, tournaments): ~7-10g per kg.\n\n\nExample\nA 70 kg (154 lb) ultimate athlete needs:\n\nRest day: ~210-350g carbs\nTraining day: ~350-490g carbs\nTournament day: ~490-700g carbs\n\n\n\n\n3. Types of Carbohydrates\nNot all carbs are the same. Understanding the differences helps with timing and performance optimization.\n\nQuick-Release Carbohydrates (Simple Carbs)\n\nFast energy, digests quickly, useful pre-game or during play.\nFound in:\n\nFruits (bananas, berries, oranges)\nHoney, maple syrup\nWhite rice\nEnergy gels, sports drinks\n\n\n\n\nSlow-Release Carbohydrates (Complex Carbs)\n\nProvide long-lasting energy and sustain performance.\nFound in:\n\nWhole grains (brown rice, quinoa, oats, whole wheat bread)\nStarchy vegetables (sweet potatoes, beans, lentils)\nLegumes (chickpeas, black beans)\n\n\n\n\n\n4. When to Consume Carbs?\n\nPre-Workout (1-3 hours before training or a match)\n\nFocus on complex carbs to ensure sustained energy.\nExamples:\n\nOatmeal with banana and honey\nWhole grain toast with peanut butter\nRice with chicken and vegetables\n\n\n\n\nDuring Training/Matches (If over 60 minutes)\n\nSimple carbs for quick energy and glycogen replenishment.\nExamples:\n\nEnergy gels, sports drinks\nBananas, dried fruit\nRice cakes with honey\n\n\n\n\nPost-Workout (Within 30-60 minutes)\n\nCombine carbs + protein to replenish glycogen and kickstart muscle recovery.\nExamples:\n\nSmoothie with protein powder, banana, and oats\nRice and lean protein (chicken, tofu, fish)\nWhole wheat wrap with hummus and turkey"

    "text": "Tournament Nutrition\nEating and drinking properly during a tournament is essential for maintaining energy, focus and performance throughout the day. Here’s a breakdown of how to fuel before, between, and after games:\n\n1. Before Playing\nYour goal here is to fuel your body with the right balance of carbohydrates for energy, protein for muscle support, and a bit of fat for sustained energy. Ideally, you should eat 1.5 to 2 hours before your game to allow digestion. Eat well and hydrate the week before the tournament.\n\nCarbohydrates: Focus on easy-to-digest carbs (like pasta, rice, oatmeal, or bread) to provide quick energy.\nProtein: Include a moderate amount of protein (chicken, turkey, tofu, yoghurt) to support muscle function.\nFats: Keep fats minimal before play (as they take longer to digest), but a small amount of healthy fats (like avocado or nuts) can help sustain you through longer games.\nHydration: Hydrate well in advance. Drink water or a sports drink with electrolytes. Avoid sugary or highly caffeinated drinks, which can lead to energy crashes.\n\nNight before: Carb-rich dinner (pasta, rice, potatoes) to maximise glycogen stores. Hydrate appropriately.\nMorning of games: A high-carb breakfast with some protein and fats (e.g. oats with nuts and berries, toast with peanut butter). Drink 500 - 700ml of water.\n\n\n2. During Games\nDuring a game, you will want to maintain energy levels and stay hydrated.\n\nSimple carbs for quick energy (fruit, dried fruit, granola bars, sports drinks).\nStay hydrated\n\nAim to refill a bottle (750ml) every game\nDrink fluids with electrolytes to maintain hydration and avoid cramping\n\n\n\n\n3. Between Games (Mid-Tournament Fueling)\nAfter a game, you’ll want to restore glycogen stores, support muscle recovery, and maintain hydration. You have a shorter window here so focus on quick, portable foods that are easily digested and provide a balance of carbs, protein, and hydration.\n\nCarbohydrates: To replenish glycogen stores, go for quick carbs like fruit (bananas, oranges), cereal bars, or even a sports drink.\nProtein: A small snack with protein helps with muscle repair. Options include nuts, Greek yoghurt, or a protein bar.\nHydration: Continue drinking water or electrolyte-rich drinks.\n\n\nExample Snack\n(15-30 minutes after a game):\n\nA banana with a small handful of nuts or trail mix.\nA protein shake or a cereal bar.\nWater or coconut water\n\n\n\n\n4. Recovery at the End of the Day\nAfter a day of playing, your body needs proper recovery to repair muscles and restore energy. Try to get some quick recovery in post-game. Then focus on a meal that provides carbs, protein, and some fats to help your body recover and replenish.\n\nCarbohydrates: Focus on high-quality carbs like sweet potatoes, quinoa, whole grains, or pasta to fully replenish glycogen.\nProtein: Include lean protein (chicken, fish, tofu, or legumes) to repair muscle tissue.\nFats: Healthy fats from sources like avocado, olive oil, or fatty fish (like salmon) can support overall recovery.\nHydration: Continue rehydrating with water or a recovery drink that replenishes electrolytes.\n\n\nExample Recovery\n\n30 - 60 minutes post-game recovery: \n\nSmoothie with protein, berries, and oats\nHydrate\n\n1 - 2 hours post-game: \n\nGrilled salmon with quinoa and steamed broccoli.\nA side of sweet potato or a whole grain salad.\nHydrate\n\n\n\n\n\n5. What to Avoid During a Tournament\n\nHeavy, greasy foods: These can sit heavy in your stomach and slow digestion, leading to discomfort and sluggishness during play (e.g. burgers, fried foods, or foods high in refined sugars).\nSugary snacks: They can cause blood sugar spikes followed by crashes, leading to fatigue. Avoid candy, soda, and sugary snacks.\nCaffeine overload: While caffeine can boost performance, too much can lead to dehydration, jitters, or energy crashes. Don’t rely on energy drinks with a lot of caffeine and sugar.\nSpicy foods: They can cause digestive discomfort or even gastrointestinal distress, which can negatively affect your performance.\nToo much fibre: While fibre is important for general health, high-fibre foods (like beans, raw veggies, or too much whole grain) may cause bloating or gas during physical activity.\n\n\n\n6. General Tips\n\nEat small, frequent meals: If you’re playing multiple games a day, don’t overeat before a game. Instead, have smaller meals or snacks that you can digest quickly.\nExperiment in practice: What works best for you might depend on your specific body and preferences. Try different foods during training to find what makes you feel best.\nStay hydrated: Keep sipping water throughout the day, especially between games. Dehydration can drastically impact performance."

They typically contain water, sugar (carbohydrates), and electrolytes like sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium.\nIf you’re participating in activities lasting over 60 minutes, sports drinks can help replace the electrolytes lost through sweat, particularly sodium and potassium, and provide a quick source of carbohydrates (sugar) for energy. Water is usually adequate for shorter or less intensive exercise.\nPost-workout sports drinks with both carbohydrates and protein (sometimes called recovery drinks) can help replenish glycogen stores and support muscle recovery.\nSports drinks are extremely convenient but do have some drawbacks such as overconsumption of added sugar and artificial ingredients, especially if you are consuming multiple drinks across a tournament weekend. If you’re looking for a more natural or homemade alternative to traditional sports drinks, here are some options:\n\nCoconut Water:\n\nCoconut water is a natural source of electrolytes (especially potassium) and is low in calories compared to most sports drinks.\n\nHomemade Electrolyte Drink:\n\n1 cup of water\n1 tablespoon of honey or maple syrup (for carbs)\n1/4 teaspoon of salt (for sodium)\nSqueeze of lemon or lime\n\nWater with a Dash of Salt and Fruit:\n\nFor a simpler alternative, add a small pinch of sea salt to your water and a few slices of citrus fruits (or berries) to enhance flavor and provide some natural vitamins.\n\nHerbal Teas or Infused Water:\n\nA refreshing hydrating option with minimal calories.\n\nWatermelon Juice:\n\nFresh watermelon juice is naturally hydrating and contains potassium and citrulline, an amino acid that can help improve blood flow and reduce muscle soreness.\n\nDiluted Fruit Juices:\n\nIf you enjoy fruit juices, dilute them with water (about 1 part juice to 2 parts water) to cut down on sugar and still provide some hydration and vitamins."

Caffeine peaks in the bloodstream about 30-60 minutes after consumption and has a half-life of about 3-5 hours, meaning its effects can last for several hours.\n\nIncreased Alertness and Focus\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that blocks neurotransmitters that promote sleep and relaxation. By doing so, caffeine improves mood, alertness, and mental focus.\n\nEnhanced Endurance Performance\n\nCaffeine can increase endurance, making it useful for long-duration activities. It can help delay fatigue and maintain performance over longer periods.\n\nImproved Muscle Performance\n\nCaffeine can enhance the contractile force of muscles, which leads to improved power output and strength.\n\nReduced Perception of Effort\n\nOne of the most notable effects of caffeine is its ability to reduce the perception of effort or how hard an activity feels.\n\nImproved Reaction Time\n\nCaffeine also tends to improve reaction time and decision-making time.\n\n\n\nPotential Downsides\n\nTolerance and Dependence\n\nOveruse can lead to tolerance, where higher doses are needed for the same effect, and dependence, where people feel they need caffeine to function normally.\n\nSleep Disruption\n\nConsuming caffeine too late in the day can interfere with sleep, which is crucial for recovery and overall performance.\nLimiting caffeine intake after 3pm is a good rule of thumb (switch to decaf!)\n\nGastrointestinal Issues\n\nSome people may experience stomach discomfort or digestive issues when consuming caffeine, especially on an empty stomach."

The primary focus of a speed endurance workout is to train your anaerobic system to resist fatigue. It should not be confused with a cardiovascular endurance workout which trains your aerobic system to effectively transport oxygen around your body.\nTraining the anaerobic system requires maximal recovery between repetitions, so speed endurance workouts should be treated like regular speed workouts.\nAerobic vs anaerobic\n\nAnaerobic (without oxygen) exercise is fueled by energy stored within your muscles.\nAerobic (with oxygen) exercise uses oxygen from the air you breathe to create energy. \n\nYour anaerobic system generates energy for short bursts of intense physical activity. The anaerobic system produces energy quickly but is limited by byproducts like lactic acid which cause fatigue and muscle pain.\nYour aerobic system generates energy for longer sustained efforts that last more than a few minutes. It uses the heart and lungs to transport oxygen to your muscles."

    "section": "Pressure to win",
    "text": "Pressure to win\nThe pressure to win is a common struggle for many athletes. It can provide motivation, but it can also be a source of anxiety and fear. Every game, every scoreline, every point, carries some form of expectation, in your mind and those of your peers.\nExpectations can cause you to play with fear, to overthink your decisions and to lose focus. They can lead to frustration, anger and disappointment when things don’t go your way, and ultimately lack of enjoyment as you become fixated on the outcome rather than the process.\nWinning is just an outcome. It’s a reflection of your performance, your team’s performance, the opposition, the circumstances of the game and a lot of random factors like the weather, the pitch and the schedule. It’s not something you can control. You can only control your own actions, your own attitude and your own effort. Wanting to win is not enough to get you over the line.\n\nAim to compete\nInstead of fixating on an uncontrollable outcome, find your desire to compete in the game. Focus on the process, the present moment and the things you are able to affect. Learn to enjoy the challenge of a close game, relish tough match ups and play with the same level of confidence regardless of the scoreline. At the end of the day, it is the moments within the game that mean the most to us. If you were handed a win without having to play, would it mean as much to you?\nPlaying to compete allows you to:\n\nEnjoy match-ups against good players, knowing that they raise your competitive level.\nBuild team chemistry and culture: Players give 100% effort, trust their teammates and support each other regardless of scorelines, errors or potential outcomes.\nBuild a more mentally resilient team that remains in the fight until the end.\nStay in the present moment, playing one point at a time, rather than racing ahead to think about the consequences.\n\nA win can only be claimed by playing, competing and fighting until the end.\n\n\nReframe losing\nWinning usually has some form of tangible benefit, a trophy, qualification spot, maybe a cash prize. On the other hand, while losing doesn’t feel great, it is rarely accompanied by any real negative consequences, especially in amateur sports. You’re no worse off than you were before the game started. You didn’t lose anything, you just didn’t win. You’re still the same person, with the same abilities and the same opportunities.\nSure your pride might be a bit dented or the result may have gone against expectation, but pride and expectation are not tangible things. They only exist in our brain and our perceptions of other people’s brains.\nPride and expectation are the two biggest contributors to ‘fear of failure’. Freeing yourself of the fear of losing is the first step to playing with freedom, confidence and a desire to compete.\nNot winning is a default state. Before the game starts, you cannot claim to have won anything. If you decide not to try at all you still won’t have won anything. Nothing lost, just no win. The only way to win is to choose to compete and give yourself a chance.\n\n\nPerspective and expectations\nDespite expectations, you are not entitled to win or guaranteed to win. There are only possibilities and opportunities that you need to make the most of.\nOur prior expectations place value on certain results and scorelines and when these are not met, we can feel disappointment (or sometimes elation).\nThese expectations can generate unhelpful noise in our minds and those of our teammates. They are based on prior experience and the experiences of others, but also our own fears and insecurities. They can be wildly unrealistic and a source of pressure and anxiety, leading to a lack of focus and enjoyment.\nWhen we have too much expectation we can over-value a game and become fixated on the outcome. When we have too little expectation we can under-value a game and lack focus and effort.\nWe can use perspective as a mental trick to help us to reassess the value we put on a game. If you are prone to over-valuation, ask yourself where the result of a game sits in the grand scheme of things?\n\nWhat will it mean to you in a week, a month, a year?\nHow important is it in relation to your life goals, career, family and friends?\nHow important is it in relation to the current political, social and economic climate?\nHow important is it in the entire history of Earth dwelling mammals?\n\nIf you are prone to under-valuation:\n\nHow important is it to my teammates that I give my best effort?\nHow dissatisfied will I be tomorrow if I don’t give my best effort now?\nAre other issues distracting me from valuing this game?\nHow lucky am I, out of everyone in the world, to be able play this game at all?\n\nMaybe that’s all you need to find the balance between relaxation and focus."

    "text": "Managing Emotions\nOften it’s the stories we attach to sport that give individual games and tournaments meaning. Whether it’s facing up against a rival, making the final as an underdog, going for the three-peat or just having a good time with our friends, the emotions we attach to games have a big impact on our performance. Emotions in sport can be good and bad, they have the capacity to both raise and hinder our performance. The trick is to find a sweet-spot between apathy and over-excitement that delivers for you.\n\nEmotions can be:\n\nNaturally heightened in sport, especially when your body is working hard and you care deeply about what you’re doing.\nValid! They are a reaction to what you perceive is happening around you, seen through a filter of how you feel about yourself and others. Your body is pretty clever and wants to tell you what’s happening. But we need to interpret and handle them with care.\nInfectious. Be aware of how your emotions affect others and the atmosphere of your team.\nNecessary. Most athletes need to be emotionally invested in a game to stay motivated and push beyond their limits.\nAcknowledged and Observed. If emotions start to become overwhelming. Take a breath. Investigate what you’re feeling and try to work out why. Remedy what you can in the moment, but sometimes we do have to work around them or let them be and come back to them later.\nReinterpreted. Nervous? Nah you’re excited and ready to go smash it. Angry? Nope, that’s just intensity. Go run faster, jump higher. Reinterpret your thoughts and feed those feelings back into your body.\n\nThere’s a psychological concept called the Yerkes-Dodson law, which suggests that some level of “arousal”, as in emotional engagement and excitement, is needed to perform at our best but that too much is unhelpful.\n\nIf too low, we’re switched off, sluggish and slow to react. Try visualisation to get hyped again.\nIf too high, we’re ready to fly off the handle and our bodies tense up. Try mindfulness to calm down again.\n\nThankfully, we play a sport where there is a lot of stoppage time. Use the moments off-pitch or between points to mentally check-in, reset and refocus. For each athlete, the optimal level of arousal will be slightly different. It probably also changes from game-to-game and day-to-day depending on a whole load of other factors. Practise recognising your emotions, understanding their origins and fine-tuning them within game settings.\n\n\n Task\n\nMake a plan to get yourself focused and emotionally invested before a match. What will you do to get hyped? What can you do if you need to cool off or relax?\nSome ideas: \n\nOnly wear your playing kit for competitive games: When it’s on, it’s game time. Time to show up.\nListen to music: Take 5 mins before team warm-up to get in the zone, ridding your mind of distractions and focusing your body.\nDeep breathing: Close your eyes and check in with your body. Take 5 deep breaths. Release any tension and calm your thoughts.\nTuck jumps or something explosive: Fire up your muscles if they’re sleepy and dial in the explosiveness. Shock yourself back into action.\nChat: If anything is distracting you from focusing on the next game, talk to someone about it. Get it off your chest, even if it can’t be resolved, talking can relieve tension.\nDe-stress actively: If you need to get moving but your mind isn’t ready to get back into a game, choose another activity. Go for a jog or do some relaxed throwing. Play spike-ball or hacky-sack."

    "section": "Dealing with mistakes",
    "text": "Dealing with mistakes\nIn order to score, ultimate teams must find a balance between retaining possession and advancing the disc towards the endzone. Possession is valued much higher than in other team sports like football, as it is relatively easy to score a point in ultimate. This means that every turnover is a direct opportunity for the opposition to score and a high percentage of turnovers are punished by opposing teams.\nDealing with mistakes is one of the biggest threats to our mental resilience, but also one of the best ways to develop it.\nMistakes happen. Even top players drop discs in games sometimes. Sometimes they even drop two in a row. Has their skill level suddenly dropped? Probably not. However, their resulting mental state may have a large impact on how they continue to play the game.\nWe all have a completion rate below 100%. Sometimes we make consecutive errors. Don’t overthink it. Try to find a root cause for the error, address it and move on. If there is nothing obvious, don’t dwell on it. If you let errors affect your confidence you create a negative feedback loop that impinges on your performance.\nMistakes can be caused by a number of factors:\n\nPhysical factors: Fatigue, injury, change in technique, opposition skills. If you identify any of these do what you can to address it and move on.\nMental factors: Overthinking, lack of focus, lack of confidence, lack of trust in teammates. What do you need to do to reset and refocus?\nLack of technique: A lot of errors just come down to lacking technique and ability. Sometimes environmental factors like increased wind or highly skilled opposition make errors more likely. This can’t be addressed in a competitive match but you can adjust the level of risk you take on to avoid further mistakes.\nDecision errors: Some people would argue that all decision errors are just technique errors. You’re brain saw a throw but you couldn’t execute it the way you intended. You should think about decision errors more in terms of probability of success. Good decisions are generally high percentage throws with low risk, that take the following into account:\n\nDegree of difficulty of the throw\nSituational information like the position of defenders, the sideline, the speed of the receiver etc.\nWhat your receiver expects. You can throw a perfectly executed throw into a wide open space, but if you’re not on the same page as your receiver then that’s a decision error. This is where training team priniciples and building chemistry pays off.\n\n\n\nAssigning Risk\nIt’s important to realise that making mistakes is part of the learning process. If you never make mistakes, you’re missing opportunities to develop your game.\nHowever, there are appropriate times to make mistakes and you should split your training focus between learning and development, and execution and performance.\nThink about the level of risk you allow yourself to take on in different training and game settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting\nAssigned Risk\nFocus\n\n\n\n\nSkill drills and pickup\nHigh risk, high reward\nTry new things, push your limits, play with freedom, make mistakes and learn from them.\n\n\nTeam drills\nMedium risk\nIn some drills, execution may be more important than skill development and turnovers can drop the focus or intensity\n\n\nTraining games\nMedium risk\nTry to execute what you’ve learned in a more competitive environment. Play without fear but operate within limits.\nAllow yourself a few opportunities to use a skill you know you can perform but don’t usually employ in games.\n\n\nCompetitions\nLow risk\nPrioritise good decision making and being aware of your limits.\nThere may be times where you need to take on more risk to win a game but this should be a calculated decision.\n\n\n\nBe aware of your current skill level and which throws you are ready to use in competitive games. Build the others up gradually:\n\nDevelop a new skill in a throwing session\nStart to use it in pickup games\nSee if you can execute consistently in drills\nDecide when a throw is “game ready”\n\n\n\nMoving on from mistakes\nEveryone has have different strategies for this, take time to work out your own. Here’s some ideas:\n\nImmediate defence - As soon as an offence mistake happens, move on immediately and switch to defence mode. There will be time between points to reflect.\nReflect and plan positive action - Once you’re off the pitch, what went wrong? Do I need to make any adjustments? Then move on. Ask for help to process if needed.\nPositive body language - Stand tall, chest out, hands on hips. Body language influences our attitude. Don’t curl up and withdraw. Don’t try to shift blame to teammates. Keep your head up.\nForgive yourself - Your teammates already have and they’ll soon forget it even happened. It’s nice to raise a hand or apologise but there’s really no need.\nHave a physical outlet - Clap. Yell. Turn anger into energy - run faster, jump higher, think sharper. Laugh if you need to.\nUse it as motivation - Remind yourself of your abilities. Use the error as motivation to get the disc back or win the game for your team."

    "section": "Trust your team",
    "text": "Trust your team\nTeam sports are hugely rewarding because they allow us to share experiences, rely on others and work together to achieve common goals. However, relationships between teammates can be complex and sometimes difficult to manage.\n\nThe dynamic between you and your teammates is just as important to your mental resilience as your own self-belief. You don’t have to be best friends with everyone on your team but it’s important to trust your teammates and have them trust you.\nTrust is a critical component of success within team sports. Teams that trust each other demonstrate good communication, support each other and are unified in their goals and team processes. The trust instilled in the team will see it through moments of adversity and frustration and keep it building towards success.\nWhen trust is lacking, players feel isolated, unsupported and unsure of their role within the team. Feelings of frustration and disappointment can spoil team morale and lead to a negative atmosphere. Players start to blame each other for mistakes, become overly critical, fade out of games or try to do too much.\nThis sounds pretty terrible but these reactions are completely normal for a team that has not spent time building confidence as a unit. Trust is not something that can be demanded or forced. It must be earned through consistent action and behaviour:\n\nWork hard off the pitch: Show that you are committed to the team, the sport and your own development. Let your team know when you’re working on your fitness or skills. Inspire, encourage and keep pushing each other.\nBe punctual: Arrive early for training and warm ups to allow the team maximal time to train and prepare.\nDo your homework: Read the training recaps and play books, ask questions and discuss strategy with your teammates. Show that you are on the same page.\nGive 100% and have your teammates backs: Sprint every cut. Chase down every disc. Show commitment to the cause. If you are willing to chase down a stray huck and attempt a layout greatest to save a teammates error, or switch mark to help a teammate that’s been beaten deep, they will be more likely to do the same for you.\nBe an active sideliner: Show your team that you are as invested in the game whether you are on the pitch or off it. Support your teammates by providing motivation and critical information.\nCommunicate openly and fairly: Be willing to talk things out when needed. Go out of your way to encourage your teammates. Be calm and willing to listen in discussions. Manage your body language carefully.\nTrust your team management: Captains and coaches have a difficult job to do. Trust that they are making decisions in the best interests of the team. If you don’t understand a decision, ask for clarification.\nBe honest and accountable: If you make a mistake, own up to it. If you need help, ask for it. If you’re struggling, let your teammates know.\nCelebrate success together: When a teammate makes a great play, let them know. When you make a great play, share the moment with your team. Get to know your teammates on and off the pitch.\nGive your teammates a chance to be trusted: None of the above is possible if you carry to much expectation or pre-conceptions of your team. Allow your teammates space to develop and grow.\n\nIt’s not easy to get to this stage, but teams that trust each other and trust in their processes are more likely to succeed. When individuals are given space and licence to play to the best of their abilities, they are more likely to play with confidence and the whole team will develop faster.\nWhen it comes to competitive matches, it is important to realise that your team and teammates are as good as they can be in that moment. You cannot suddenly expect more of them than they are capable of. You must trust that they will do their best and that you will do your best and that the result will take care of itself."

Similarly, whilst rowing, cycling and swimming are great for developing fitness and endurance, they’re not recruiting the muscles we use in running, at least not in the same way.\nWe’ll benefit the most from running as it trains endurance in the specific muscles and ranges of motion of our running strides. It also prepares our joints for impact and all the small muscles and tendons used to control our movement.\nUsing workouts which incorporate periods of rest teaches your body to recover quickly before the next effort. This is essential to ultimate - using those few minutes on the sideline to get your heart rate back down and being ready to give 100% next time you take the field."

The focus of your strength work is not to shift a lot of heavy weight, it’s to make you perform better on-field. With this in mind, workouts for ultimate players tend to focus on specific muscles and movements:\n\nPowerful leg muscles for explosive actions (running, jumping, turning etc)\nCore strength for throwing and diving\nShoulder strength and flexibility for throwing and injury prevention on landing\nStrong support around the knees for applying large forces at different angles when landing and changing direction (often on one leg)\nHip strength and mobility to improve sprint and agility technique\nFunctional strength exercises using body-weight or free weights rather than machines\n\nFunctional strength exercises employ multiple muscle groups through ranges of motion. If your focus is to become a better ultimate player, then your gym work should complement your on field actions. Later on, we will discuss how you can progress your S&C routine to include more power-based exercises. However, it is important to do some baseline strength first to avoid overloading and injury."

    "title": "Preparing For Trials",
    "section": "",
    "text": "As the off-season comes to a close, competitive teams will announce their plans for the upcoming season and send out invitations to trials. Whether you are trialing for a local club or an international squad, here are our top ten tips for trials.\n\n\n1. Sign up!\nThe first top tip is just to sign up. There’s no binding contract and nothing to lose. Whether you make the squad or not, trials are a great opportunity to challenge yourself, match up against new players and figure out where you stand. Don’t try to second guess whether you are good enough or if the team is likely to select you, just go out, be yourself and give it your best shot. Remember that trials work both ways. They are also a chance for you to go see what a team is all about and if they’re the right fit for you.\n\n\n2. Be prepared\nIt’s the scout motto and the first rule of competitive sports. Control the things you can control. You cannot control the weather, who is defending you, the thoughts of the selectors or the traffic on the way to the venue. But there are plenty of things that are within your control:\n\nPlan your travel, check the traffic and arrive in time to use the toilets or changing rooms and still be early for the warmup\nCheck the weather and pack for different eventualities (layers, waterproofs, gloves, waterproof your bag)\nMake a checklist and pack a bag the night before:\n\nWhat kit do you need?\nWhat food and drink do you need?\nDo you have spare boots?\n\nWere you supposed to read anything beforehand or fill in a form?\nEat well, hydrate and get some decent sleep in the lead up\nThink about your fitness sessions the week before and how much recovery time you need\n\n\n\n3. Throw everyday\nTrials often take place early in the season and you probably haven’t played a lot of outdoor ultimate for a while. Get your hands on a disc everyday the week before your trial. Make sure your throws are dialled in and ready to go.\n\n\n4. Stand out!\nSelectors at trials need to assess a lot of people, many of whom they might never have met before. It’s in your interest to make sure the selectors and observers notice and remember who you are.\nSome people have naturally distinctive looks or physical attributes that attract attention (I’m looking at you tall people), but others can blur into the background. Although good captains and coaches may be aware of their bias they are still susceptible to it.\nIf you’re attending a trial for a new team, you could try wearing something distinctive. A bright orange hat or a noticeable kit. Nothing ridiculous, but just enough for the selectors to refer to you as ‘the girl with the Colombia shirt’ for instance. And remember, feel good - play good. If getting a haircut and wearing your favourite sports kit makes you feel confident, then use that to your advantage.\nAlternatively, just introduce yourself to people and talk. Let people know who you are. Don’t be afraid to be vocal and express your personality. Making a few early connections can also help to settle any nerves you may have.\n\n\n5. Read the question\nThis phrase may sound familiar from your school days. Remember those smart kids that failed assessments because they failed to read the question properly? Who sets the questions at a team trial? The selectors.\nThere’s nothing wrong with having your own style of play and your own ideas on strategy. However, you must be able to show that you can fit in with the team ethos and demonstrate the skills that the selectors require.\nIf the team has a trial prep document, ensure you read it and have a good idea of what the selectors are looking for at trials. Make sure you understand the focus of each drill and what you might be assessed on.\n\n\n6. Ask questions\nThere is nothing wrong with asking questions at trials. No one is going to judge you for not understanding a drill or strategy that you might never have seen before. It is far better to ask someone to repeat a line call for instance than to start the point not knowing what you’re doing.\nBesides, coaches love it when you ask them questions, it shows that you’re interested in the things they spend time thinking about. Asking questions shows that you are focused on the task and want to do it correctly. Coachability ranks high amongst selection criteria for trialists.\n\n\n7. Be a good teammate\nTrials can be a bit weird. There’s always a thought in the back of your mind that you’re competing against everyone there for a spot on the team. Selectors love to see competitive spirit but they also want to see players forming partnerships and developing understanding with their teammates. Cut to make space for other players on the pitch, communicate well and work hard on defence. Cheer on your team and celebrate other people’s successes. If you can show that you inspire people and raise everyone’s game, that’s a massive skill that every team desires.\n\n\n8. No regrets\nSometimes a trial is the only chance you get to impress selectors and make a team. Make sure you leave the trial without any regrets. Be confident and make the most of it. If you find yourself playing out of position, ask to be given a different role. If you have a particular skill that makes you stand out from the pack, give yourself an opportunity to showcase it.\n\n\n9. Know your strengths\nMost of the available spots on a team go to players who are:\n\nReliable all rounders: Grind hard, competent disc skills, rarely turn over.\nValuable outliers: Possess a skill that few others bring to the team (e.g. big in the air, full pitch hucks, insane speed, supreme disc skills)\nOccasionally a bit of both\n\nAsk yourself what you can bring to the team and which skills you need to display at trials.\n\n\n10. Ask for feedback: Whether you make the team or not\nWhether you make the squad or not, you can gain valuable experience from trials and use them as a measuring stick for your level of performance. It’s always good to ask for feedback from the selectors. This can help identify areas of your game to work on and guide your continued development.\n\n\nBonus Tip: Have fun!\nEnjoy the trial. It’s not an exam or a job interview, it’s just a training session, playing the sport you love, where you get to show everyone what you’ve got. If you’re having fun you’ll:\n\nStand out\nPlay your best\nMake new friends and hopefully new teammates\n\nGood luck this trial season!"

    "title": "30 Tips For Throwing Drills",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Improving your throwing skills requires focused, dedicated practice. Whether you are warming up for training or taking part in a dedicated skills session, make sure you are getting optimal benefit from your reps. Here are some tips for getting the most out of your throwing drills.\n\nTechnique first\nNail the technique first, before you add defense, before you try to throw hard, before you over complicate your drills, get the technique down. Get feedback from a coach, teammate or video analysis.\n\n\nRepetition\nBy repeating a similar task multiple times we develop muscle memory. Making multiple throws in quick succession allows us to replicate good technique and correct poor form. Drilling with a constant supply of discs is ideal when working on technique. Be sure to rest regularly to avoid loss of form through lack of focus or fatigue.\n\n\nAdd variation\nOnce your technique is sound, play around with varying certain elements of your drills to develop your skills.\n\n\nBe specific\nIt’s not just a backhand. Be specific about the perfect pass, the shape of the throw, the game scenario and the target you want to hit.\n\n\nVisualise - Execute - Evaluate\nVisualise a specific throw. Execute without over-thinking. Evaluate the result.\n\n\nDon’t over-think it\nConsciously thinking about individual body parts can be distracting and overwhelming. Give yourself feedback with verbs and adverbs: “Faster, more flick, smoother, pivot wider etc”\n\n\nVisualise game scenarios\nImagine a situation where you would use the throw you are drilling in a game. Visualise the direction of play, the sideline, your team mates, defender positioning etc. This will help you to maintain focus in drills and apply the skills during play.\n\n\nExaggeration\nExaggerating skills can be a useful method to gain control and range of technique. For instance, if you naturally tend to throw with roll-curve and can’t get the hang of inside-out, try throwing high, loopy, sharp IO angled backhands to begin with.\n\n\nUse your time effectively\nIf you think 90% of your on field throws will be forehand or backhand then spend the most time perfecting these throws.\n\n\nResearch and development\nDevote some time to working on new throws or changes in technique. Keep working on technique in your throwing sessions until you are comfortable to use it in drills. You’ll then find it will naturally creep into your game. It’s also fun to play around with some new throws at the end of a session to wind down.\n\n\nCatching practice\nThrowing drills are generally catching drills as well, don’t be lazy with your catching technique.\n\n\nThrow to targets\nWhether it’s a set of cones or a receiver, give yourself a small target to aim for. Receivers can raise their hands as targets to improve accuracy, think about where you want the player to catch the disc (left side, chest, right side, high). Passes in matches often have a large margin for error as we are throwing to running receivers that can change their speed and direction. Developing accuracy therefore requires deliberate and focused throwing practice.\n\n\nUse props\nTrees and cones can make good targets (disc golf) and good forces to throw around.\n\n\nMaintain focus and intensity\nDon’t let a dropped disc disturb the pace of a drill.\n\n\nThrow when it’s windy\nThe wind offers resistance and highlights flaws in your technique. If you can learn to throw in the wind you’ll be amazed at what you can do on a still day. As well as throwing through the wind, learn to use it to get your disc to the intended target.\n\n\nRotate your drills\nChange up the wind direction and learn to throw in different winds.\n\n\nThrow to moving targets\nIn games we throw to moving targets more often than stationary ones. Think about the types of cuts you would make in a game.\n\n\nPractice moving into a throw\nIn games we often receive the disc from one direction, then turn and throw in another direction. We also receive the disc on the move. Try to replicate these movements in some of your drills.\n\n\n3 &gt; 2\nThrowing in pairs is fine and will give you lots of reps, but a 3rd person can add defense, continuation throws or multiple throwing options to your drills, making them more game-like.\n\n\nUse multiple discs\nIncrease your reps and time between reps by using a stack of discs or having multiple discs in the air at once. \n\n\nPlay defense\nPlay defense at a challenging level for the offense players so they get the most out of drills.\n\n\nReactive or random drills\nAdd a reactive or random element to drills to force the thrower to think and execute quickly.\n\n\nVersatility\nGood throwers have many tools at their disposal and can use multiple throws in the same situation. Use different throws in drills to hit the same targets.\n\n\nPlay small sided games\nSmall sided games are a great way to get lots of realistic, randomised throwing reps. Make sure you have a focus and think about applying conditions or scenarios to the game to aid your learning.\n\n\nChallenge yourself\nImprove by working at the limits of your ability and trying to push beyond. If you are throwing long, set a cone to aim for that is just beyond a comfortable distance for you. If you are working on wide pivots try this drill.\n\n\nBe okay with making mistakes\nDeliberate practice occurs outside of your comfort zone. It should be difficult, don’t beat yourself up when you make errors. Try to remain in a state of relaxed concentration.\n\n\nScale the difficulty\nIf a drill is too difficult for you to complete then think of ways to scale down the difficulty. Remove one of the variables or ask the defense to be less active. \n\n\nConsistency\nConsistency and accuracy should be a prime focus. Skill development isn’t all about new techniques and throwing further. Consistently executing the throws you already have will make you an effective and reliable player. This is especially important in the lead up to tournaments where you want to feel confident hitting low risk options.\n\n\nTake a break\nFocused, deliberate practice can be physically and mentally draining. When your concentration or form dips, take a break. Increasing your focused time over multiple sessions can help build your mental toughness.\n\n\nCross training\nA lot of athletic and coordination skills are transferable across sports. Don’t feel like you always need to play ultimate to work on your skills. Basketball and volleyball are great for jumping technique; Spikeball requires quick reactions and the occasional layout; a round of disc golf can give you new insights on your throwing technique."

    "text": "Repetition and muscle memory\nSkill development is a brain-to-muscle activity. When learning a skill, the initial focus should be on technique, repetition and breaking the skill down into core components. For instance, when learning to throw a forehand, you could focus on the following:\n\nFootwork: Set your stance and get into a balanced pivot\nGrip: Check your grip is correct and the disc is held in the correct position\nRelease action: Use a “whipping” motion to spin the disc \nFollow through: Maintain balance and “finish forward” with your throwing action \n\nYou then want to throw hundreds or even thousands of forehands, focussing on technique and making small adjustments until you can execute the throw consistently. Eventually the skill becomes a more fluid motion as muscle memory is created and the task moves from a focussed conscious effort towards subconscious execution. \nFocusing on good technique is critical, otherwise you ingrain bad habits that are hard to unlearn. Consider getting help from a coach, a teammate or videoing your throws to analyse later."

It makes instinctive approximations about speed, angles, distance, height etc. Those approximations are all based on combinations of past experiences and are refined through hours of training. Your brain is a prediction machine. It is constantly taking in information from the outside world and using past information to try to predict the future. Similar to machine learning algorithms, the accuracy of these prediction models depend on having many, many data points and a dataset that accurately represents variation within the system. \nBasically, experience counts. Add variation to your drills to develop your skill and become an adaptable thrower. You can’t drill every possible combination, but you can add enough variation for your brain to accurately fill in the gaps when faced with new scenarios.\n\nEXAMPLE\nChanging the target distance every 10 throws can be better practice than 100 throws at a fixed distance.\nOne trademark of veteran throwers is the ability to perform micro-corrections mid way through the throwing action to adjust for imbalances in form. You might recognise the situation where your technique feels awful but you somehow get the disc to go where you wanted. This is often a sign that your brain is correcting your actions in real time to adjust for slight changes in technique."

There are many pro disc golfers and freestylers that have undeniable skills with a disc but can’t play Ultimate at a high level. \nIn our sport there are multiple moving receivers and defenders that are constantly changing position and affecting the types of throws required to hit the available targets. You have to process a lot of dynamic information on the fly and also consider the weather, the dimensions of the pitch, your field position and a distracting force trying to point-block or foul you! Drills with minimal additional variables can be good for technique and development, but to get your throws game ready you must practise them in specific scenarios that replicate game like conditions.\nThese types of drills improve your capacity to control and adjust throws, increase spatial awareness and heighten your ability to anticipate play. They require a certain level of technique but are hugely beneficial in training your brain to see a scenario in front of you, select a throwing option and execute the required skill.\nWhenever you receive the disc, you are faced with a scenario you have never seen before. You may have had many similar experiences but nothing identical. Subconsciously, you call on a collection of past experiences, assess the information in front of you, and make a quick decision about the pass you want to attempt. It’s then up to your muscle memory to execute the movements required to perform the envisaged throw, a product of training and learning your technique.\nTraining these game time decisions is crucial to implementing your skills in games and being able to call on the right throw at the right time. You can do this by:\n\nRunning game like drills\n\nInclude defense, add sidelines, multiple throwing options and targets\n\nReactive drills\n\nDrills where things can change every rep \n\ne.g. forcing direction, cutting patterns, different receiver, different throw\n\n\nSmall sided games\n\nGreat for getting lots of touches in different situations"

    "text": "Visualisation\n\nVisualise, execute, evaluate\nVisualisation is a powerful tool for developing throws with deliberate practice.  \n\nVisualise the specific throw you want to make\nExecute without thinking too much, just try to produce the desired outcome\nEvaluate the outcome:\n\nDid the result match your intention? \n\nDid the movements feel right?\nDid you maintain balance throughout the throw?\nDid you get enough snap on release?\n\nWhat adjustments do you need to make?  \n\n\nOne useful drill is to throw two discs in quick succession. With the second throw, to try to either  a) replicate a well executed first throw or b) correct the errors in the first throw. \n\n\nVisualise game like scenarios\nEven if you are only practicing with one other player, you can still imagine game-like scenarios and the throw you wish to execute. Imagine where you are on the pitch, what the defense is doing and the type of throw you want to make. \n\n\nBrain training\nVisualisation can also be a really valuable tool away from the pitch. Putting yourself in game situations in your head, or replaying past scenarios is valuable brain training and will help you make better decisions in future. Daydreaming can really make you a better player!"

    "section": "Perfect Passing",
    "text": "Perfect Passing\nFootball coaches use the phrase “perfect passing” to describe the thought process required when moving the ball. A pass is not simply kicking the ball, or throwing the disc to a player on your team. Some of the things to think about when making the perfect pass:\n\nThe target: \n\nIs it a pass directly to a player or out into space?\nAre we aiming for the players chest, their outstretched hand or the space above them?\n\nThrowing shape:\n\nFlat, roll curve, IO…\nWhat throwing shape evades defenders and fades towards the receiver?\n\nSpeed of the pass:\n\nHow fast does the disc need to go to be catchable at the target?\nDoes it need front edge or extra spin to float in space?\n\nTiming of release:\n\nWhen should the pass be released to hit the receiver in full flow?\n\nDefense and sidelines\n\nWhat pivot, throw, release point do I need to beat the force?\nWhich defenders are in positions to block the intended throw?\nWhat margin of error is there with sidelines and defense positioning?\n\nWeather conditions\n\nHow will the wind affect this throw? Do I need to adjust the angle, spin, speed etc?\n\n\nAll of the calculations above are performed with split-second timing (often subconsciously) with two aims in mind:\n\nCompleting a successful, catchable pass\nThe receivers next move i.e. continuation\n\n\nEXAMPLE\nPass: Throw to my reset \nPerfect pass: Pivot low and wide around the force. Throw a leading pass backhand into the space just beyond my receiver’s right shoulder. Raise the front edge to allow the disc to float in front of them and a touch of roll curve so that the disc bends towards the receiver’s path. This will give the receiver the best opportunity to continue the swing across the field.\nWhen running drills or practicing your throwing, you should think about the “perfect pass” for each situation and intentionally focus on specific aspects of the throw."

Unless you become a full time athlete, it is very difficult to train all of these aspects at the same time.\nGoal setting is one way to focus on the specific elements of training that will benefit you the most. Tailor your training to target key strengths or weaknesses based on your role on a team or the player you want to become.\nAnother strategy is to adopt a progressive training plan that changes throughout the season to build towards peak performance."
