title: "Mind Games"

The ability to perform under pressure, manage emotions and maintain focus are all critical to success on the pitch. Some athletes possess all of the physical attributes to succeed at the highest level but still struggle to perform when it matters most. This is where mental training can make a significant difference.

![](images/men_kar.jpg){width="100%"}

Matches between equal opponents are often **won and lost in the mind**. Who wants it more? Who can handle the pressure? Who can block out external noise and focus on the task at hand?

Athletes that perform consistently, regardless of the opposition, competition or stakes, demonstrate control over their mental state and the games that play out in their heads. They are able to remain calm, focused and positive, even when things aren't going to plan.

Knowing which emotions to recognise and which to ignore at critical moments. Remaining positive after making mistakes. Motivating yourself and your teammates. Blocking out thoughts of expectations and outcomes. These are all learned skills that athletes can acquire through intentional practice.

Put yourself in pressure situations. Embrace and enjoy competitive moments. Become aware of your emotions, fears and mental state throughout games. Build your **mental resilience** and develop a solid **awareness of your own abilities**. These skills will not only see you succeed on the ultimate pitch, but also in life.

## Pressure to win

The pressure to win is a common struggle for many athletes. It can provide motivation, but it can also be a source of anxiety and fear. Every game, every scoreline, every point, carries some form of expectation, in your mind and those of your peers.

Expectations can cause you to play with fear, to overthink your decisions and to lose focus. They can lead to frustration, anger and disappointment when things don't go your way, and ultimately lack of enjoyment as you become fixated on the outcome rather than the process.

Winning is just an outcome. It's a reflection of your performance, your team's performance, the opposition, the circumstances of the game and a lot of random factors like the weather, the pitch and the schedule. It's not something you can control. You can only control your own actions, your own attitude and your own effort. Wanting to win is not enough to get you over the line.

### Aim to compete

Instead of fixating on an uncontrollable outcome, find your **desire to compete** in the game. Focus on the process, the present moment and the things you are able to affect. Learn to enjoy the challenge of a close game, relish tough match ups and play with the same level of confidence regardless of the scoreline. At the end of the day, it is the moments within the game that mean the most to us. If you were handed a win without having to play, would it mean as much to you?

Playing to **compete** allows you to:

-   **Enjoy match-ups against good players**, knowing that they raise your competitive level.

-   **Build team chemistry and culture**: Players give 100% effort, trust their teammates and support each other regardless of scorelines, errors or potential outcomes.

-   **Build a more mentally resilient team** that remains in the fight until the end.

-   **Stay in the present moment**, playing one point at a time, rather than racing ahead to think about the consequences.

A win can only be claimed by playing, competing and fighting until the end.

### Reframe losing

Winning usually has some form of tangible benefit, a trophy, qualification spot, maybe a cash prize. On the other hand, while losing doesn't feel great, it is rarely accompanied by any real negative consequences, especially in amateur sports. You're no worse off than you were before the game started. You didn't lose anything, you just didn't win. You're still the same person, with the same abilities and the same opportunities.

Sure your pride might be a bit dented or the result may have gone against expectation, but pride and expectation are not tangible things. They only exist in our brain and our perceptions of other people's brains.

Pride and expectation are the two biggest contributors to 'fear of failure'. Freeing yourself of the fear of losing is the first step to playing with freedom, confidence and a desire to compete.

Not winning is a default state. Before the game starts, you cannot claim to have won anything. If you decide not to try at all you still won't have won anything. Nothing lost, just no win. The only way to win is to choose to compete and give yourself a chance.

### Perspective and expectations

Despite expectations, you are not entitled to win or guaranteed to win. There are only possibilities and opportunities that you need to make the most of.

Our prior expectations place value on certain results and scorelines and when these are not met, we can feel disappointment (or sometimes elation).

These expectations can generate unhelpful noise in our minds and those of our teammates. They are based on prior experience and the experiences of others, but also our own fears and insecurities. They can be wildly unrealistic and a source of pressure and anxiety, leading to a lack of focus and enjoyment.

When we have too much expectation we can **over-value** a game and become fixated on the outcome. When we have too little expectation we can **under-value** a game and lack focus and effort.

We can use **perspective** as a mental trick to help us to reassess the value we put on a game. If you are prone to over-valuation, ask yourself where the result of a game sits in the grand scheme of things?

-   What will it mean to you in a week, a month, a year?
-   How important is it in relation to your life goals, career, family and friends?
-   How important is it in relation to the current political, social and economic climate?
-   How important is it in the entire history of Earth dwelling mammals?

If you are prone to under-valuation:

-   How important is it to my teammates that I give my best effort?
-   How dissatisfied will I be tomorrow if I don't give my best effort now?
-   Are other issues distracting me from valuing this game?
-   How lucky am I, out of everyone in the world, to be able play this game at all?

Maybe that's all you need to find the balance between relaxation and focus.

## Managing Emotions

Often it's the stories we attach to sport that give individual games and tournaments meaning. Whether it's facing up against a rival, making the final as an underdog, going for the three-peat or just having a good time with our friends, the emotions we attach to games have a big impact on our performance. Emotions in sport can be good and bad, they have the capacity to both raise and hinder our performance. The trick is to find a sweet-spot between apathy and over-excitement that delivers for you.

![](images/men_han.jpg){width="100%"}

Emotions can be:

-   **Naturally heightened in sport**, especially when your body is working hard and you care deeply about what you’re doing.

-   **Valid!** They are a reaction to what you perceive is happening around you, seen through a filter of how you feel about yourself and others. Your body is pretty clever and wants to tell you what’s happening. But we need to interpret and handle them with care.

-   **Infectious**. Be aware of how your emotions affect others and the atmosphere of your team.

-   **Necessary**. Most athletes need to be emotionally invested in a game to stay motivated and push beyond their limits.

-   **Acknowledged and Observed**. If emotions start to become overwhelming. Take a breath. Investigate what you’re feeling and try to work out why. Remedy what you can in the moment, but sometimes we do have to work around them or let them be and come back to them later.

-   **Reinterpreted**. Nervous? Nah you’re excited and ready to go smash it. Angry? Nope, that’s just intensity. Go run faster, jump higher. Reinterpret your thoughts and feed those feelings back into your body.

There’s a psychological concept called the Yerkes-Dodson law, which suggests that some level of “arousal”, as in emotional engagement and excitement, is needed to perform at our best but that too much is unhelpful.

-   If too low, we’re switched off, sluggish and slow to react. Try **visualisation** to get hyped again.

-   If too high, we’re ready to fly off the handle and our bodies tense up. Try **mindfulness** to calm down again.

Thankfully, we play a sport where there is a lot of stoppage time. Use the moments off-pitch or between points to mentally check-in, reset and refocus. For each athlete, the optimal level of arousal will be slightly different. It probably also changes from game-to-game and day-to-day depending on a whole load of other factors. Practise recognising your emotions, understanding their origins and fine-tuning them within game settings.

<h2><i class="far fa-check-square"></i> Task</h2>

Make a plan to get yourself focused and emotionally invested before a match. What will you do to get hyped? What can you do if you need to cool off or relax?

Some ideas: 

-   **Only wear your playing kit for competitive games**: When it’s on, it’s game time. Time to show up.

-   **Listen to music**: Take 5 mins before team warm-up to get in the zone, ridding your mind of distractions and focusing your body.

-   **Deep breathing**: Close your eyes and check in with your body. Take 5 deep breaths. Release any tension and calm your thoughts.

-   **Tuck jumps or something explosive**: Fire up your muscles if they’re sleepy and dial in the explosiveness. Shock yourself back into action.

-   **Chat**: If anything is distracting you from focusing on the next game, talk to someone about it. Get it off your chest, even if it can't be resolved, talking can relieve tension.

-   **De-stress actively**: If you need to get moving but your mind isn't ready to get back into a game, choose another activity. Go for a jog or do some relaxed throwing. Play spike-ball or hacky-sack.

## Dealing with mistakes

In order to score, ultimate teams must find a balance between retaining possession and advancing the disc towards the endzone. Possession is valued much higher than in other team sports like football, as it is relatively easy to score a point in ultimate. This means that every turnover is a direct opportunity for the opposition to score and a high percentage of turnovers are punished by opposing teams.

Dealing with mistakes is one of the biggest threats to our mental resilience, but also one of the best ways to develop it.

Mistakes happen. Even top players drop discs in games sometimes. Sometimes they even drop two in a row. Has their skill level suddenly dropped? Probably not. However, their resulting mental state may have a large impact on how they continue to play the game.

We all have a completion rate below 100%. Sometimes we make consecutive errors. Don't overthink it. Try to find a root cause for the error, address it and move on. If there is nothing obvious, don't dwell on it. If you let errors affect your confidence you create a negative feedback loop that impinges on your performance.

Mistakes can be caused by a number of factors:

-   **Physical factors**: Fatigue, injury, change in technique, opposition skills. If you identify any of these do what you can to address it and move on.

-   **Mental factors**: Overthinking, lack of focus, lack of confidence, lack of trust in teammates. What do you need to do to reset and refocus?

-   **Lack of technique**: A lot of errors just come down to lacking technique and ability. Sometimes environmental factors like increased wind or highly skilled opposition make errors more likely. This can't be addressed in a competitive match but you can adjust the level of risk you take on to avoid further mistakes.

-   **Decision errors**: Some people would argue that all decision errors are just technique errors. You're brain saw a throw but you couldn't execute it the way you intended. You should think about decision errors more in terms of probability of success. Good decisions are generally high percentage throws with low risk, that take the following into account:

    -   Degree of difficulty of the throw

    -   Situational information like the position of defenders, the sideline, the speed of the receiver etc.

    -   What your receiver expects. You can throw a perfectly executed throw into a wide open space, but if you're not on the same page as your receiver then that's a decision error. This is where training team priniciples and building chemistry pays off.

### Assigning Risk

It's important to realise that making mistakes is part of the learning process. If you never make mistakes, you're missing opportunities to develop your game.

However, there are appropriate times to make mistakes and you should split your training focus between **learning** **and** **development**, and **execution** **and** **performance**.

Think about the level of risk you allow yourself to take on in different training and game settings.

+-------------------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Setting                 | Assigned Risk          | Focus                                                                                                                |
+=========================+========================+======================================================================================================================+
| Skill drills and pickup | High risk, high reward | Try new things, push your limits, play with freedom, make mistakes and learn from them.                              |
+-------------------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Team drills             | Medium risk            | In some drills, execution may be more important than skill development and turnovers can drop the focus or intensity |
+-------------------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Training games          | Medium risk            | Try to execute what you've learned in a more competitive environment. Play without fear but operate within limits.   |
|                         |                        |                                                                                                                      |
|                         |                        | Allow yourself a few opportunities to use a skill you know you can perform but don't usually employ in games.        |
+-------------------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Competitions            | Low risk               | Prioritise good decision making and being aware of your limits.                                                      |
|                         |                        |                                                                                                                      |
|                         |                        | There may be times where you need to take on more risk to win a game but this should be a calculated decision.       |
+-------------------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Be aware of your current skill level and which throws you are ready to use in competitive games. Build the others up gradually:

-   Develop a new skill in a throwing session

-   Start to use it in pickup games

-   See if you can execute consistently in drills

-   Decide when a throw is "game ready"

### Moving on from mistakes

Everyone has have different strategies for this, take time to work out your own. Here’s some ideas:

1.  **Immediate defence** - As soon as an offence mistake happens, move on immediately and switch to defence mode. There will be time between points to reflect.

2.  **Reflect and plan positive action** - Once you’re off the pitch, what went wrong? Do I need to make any adjustments? Then move on. Ask for help to process if needed.

3.  **Positive body language** - Stand tall, chest out, hands on hips. Body language influences our attitude. Don’t curl up and withdraw. Don't try to shift blame to teammates. Keep your head up.

4.  **Forgive yourself** - Your teammates already have and they’ll soon forget it even happened. It's nice to raise a hand or apologise but there's really no need.

5.  **Have a physical outlet** - Clap. Yell. Turn anger into energy - run faster, jump higher, think sharper. Laugh if you need to.

6.  **Use it as motivation** - Remind yourself of your abilities. Use the error as motivation to get the disc back or win the game for your team.

## Trust your team

Team sports are hugely rewarding because they allow us to share experiences, rely on others and work together to achieve common goals. However, relationships between teammates can be complex and sometimes difficult to manage.

![](images/men_team.jpg){width="100%"}

The dynamic between you and your teammates is just as important to your mental resilience as your own self-belief. You don't have to be best friends with everyone on your team but it's important to trust your teammates and have them trust you.

Trust is a critical component of success within team sports. Teams that trust each other demonstrate good communication, support each other and are unified in their goals and team processes. The trust instilled in the team will see it through moments of adversity and frustration and keep it building towards success.

When trust is lacking, players feel isolated, unsupported and unsure of their role within the team. Feelings of frustration and disappointment can spoil team morale and lead to a negative atmosphere. Players start to blame each other for mistakes, become overly critical, fade out of games or try to do too much.

This sounds pretty terrible but these reactions are completely normal for a team that has not spent time building confidence as a unit. Trust is not something that can be demanded or forced. It must be earned through consistent action and behaviour:

-   **Work hard off the pitch**: Show that you are committed to the team, the sport and your own development. Let your team know when you're working on your fitness or skills. Inspire, encourage and keep pushing each other.

-   **Be punctual**: Arrive early for training and warm ups to allow the team maximal time to train and prepare.

-   **Do your homework**: Read the training recaps and play books, ask questions and discuss strategy with your teammates. Show that you are on the same page.

-   **Give 100% and have your teammates backs**: Sprint every cut. Chase down every disc. Show commitment to the cause. If you are willing to chase down a stray huck and attempt a layout greatest to save a teammates error, or switch mark to help a teammate that's been beaten deep, they will be more likely to do the same for you.

-   **Be an active sideliner**: Show your team that you are as invested in the game whether you are on the pitch or off it. Support your teammates by providing motivation and critical information.

-   **Communicate openly and fairly**: Be willing to talk things out when needed. Go out of your way to encourage your teammates. Be calm and willing to listen in discussions. Manage your body language carefully.

-   **Trust your team management**: Captains and coaches have a difficult job to do. Trust that they are making decisions in the best interests of the team. If you don't understand a decision, ask for clarification.

-   **Be honest and accountable**: If you make a mistake, own up to it. If you need help, ask for it. If you're struggling, let your teammates know.

-   **Celebrate success together**: When a teammate makes a great play, let them know. When you make a great play, share the moment with your team. Get to know your teammates on and off the pitch.

-   **Give your teammates a chance to be trusted**: None of the above is possible if you carry to much expectation or pre-conceptions of your team. Allow your teammates space to develop and grow.

It's not easy to get to this stage, but teams that trust each other and trust in their processes are more likely to succeed. When individuals are given space and licence to play to the best of their abilities, they are more likely to play with confidence and the whole team will develop faster.

When it comes to competitive matches, it is important to realise that your team and teammates are as good as they can be in that moment. You cannot suddenly expect more of them than they are capable of. You must trust that they will do their best and that you will do your best and that the result will take care of itself.
