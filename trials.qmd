title: "Preparing For Trials"

As the off-season comes to a close, competitive teams will announce their plans for the upcoming season and send out invitations to trials. Whether you are trialing for a local club or an international squad, here are our top ten tips for trials.

### 1. Sign up!

The first top tip is just to sign up. There’s no binding contract and **nothing to lose**. Whether you make the squad or not, trials are a great opportunity to challenge yourself, match up against new players and figure out where you stand. Don’t try to second guess whether you are good enough or if the team is likely to select you, just go out, be yourself and give it your best shot. Remember that trials work both ways. They are also a chance for you to go see what a team is all about and if they’re the right fit for you.

### 2. Be prepared

It’s the scout motto and the first rule of competitive sports. **Control the things you can control**. You cannot control the weather, who is defending you, the thoughts of the selectors or the traffic on the way to the venue. But there are plenty of things that are within your control:

-   Plan your travel, check the traffic and arrive in time to use the toilets or changing rooms and still be early for the warmup

-   Check the weather and pack for different eventualities (layers, waterproofs, gloves, waterproof your bag)

-   Make a checklist and pack a bag the night before:

    -   What kit do you need?

    -   What food and drink do you need?

    -   Do you have spare boots?

-   Were you supposed to read anything beforehand or fill in a form?

-   Eat well, hydrate and get some decent sleep in the lead up

-   Think about your fitness sessions the week before and how much recovery time you need

### 3. Throw everyday

Trials often take place early in the season and you probably haven’t played a lot of outdoor ultimate for a while. **Get your hands on a disc everyday** the week before your trial. Make sure your throws are dialled in and ready to go.

### 4. Stand out!

Selectors at trials need to assess a lot of people, many of whom they might never have met before. It’s in your interest to make sure the selectors and observers **notice and remember** who you are.

Some people have naturally distinctive looks or physical attributes that attract attention (I’m looking at you tall people), but others can blur into the background. Although good captains and coaches may be aware of their bias they are still susceptible to it.

If you’re attending a trial for a new team, you could try wearing something distinctive. A bright orange hat or a noticeable kit. Nothing ridiculous, but just enough for the selectors to refer to you as ‘the girl with the Colombia shirt’ for instance. And remember, feel good - play good. If getting a haircut and wearing your favourite sports kit makes you feel confident, then use that to your advantage.

Alternatively, just introduce yourself to people and talk. Let people know who you are. Don’t be afraid to be vocal and express your personality. Making a few early connections can also help to settle any nerves you may have.

### 5. Read the question

This phrase may sound familiar from your school days. Remember those smart kids that failed assessments because they failed to read the question properly? Who sets the questions at a team trial? The selectors.

There’s nothing wrong with having your own style of play and your own ideas on strategy. However, you must be able to **show that you can fit in with the team ethos** and demonstrate the skills that the selectors require.

If the team has a trial prep document, ensure you read it and have a good idea of what the selectors are looking for at trials. Make sure you understand the focus of each drill and what you might be assessed on.

### 6. Ask questions

There is nothing wrong with asking questions at trials. No one is going to judge you for not understanding a drill or strategy that you might never have seen before. It is far better to ask someone to repeat a line call for instance than to start the point not knowing what you’re doing.

Besides, coaches love it when you ask them questions, it shows that you’re interested in the things they spend time thinking about. Asking questions shows that you are focused on the task and want to do it correctly. **Coachability** ranks high amongst selection criteria for trialists.

### 7. Be a good teammate

Trials can be a bit weird. There’s always a thought in the back of your mind that you’re competing against everyone there for a spot on the team. Selectors love to see competitive spirit but they also want to see players forming partnerships and developing understanding with their teammates. Cut to make space for other players on the pitch, communicate well and work hard on defence. Cheer on your team and celebrate other people’s successes. If you can show that you **inspire people** and raise everyone’s game, that’s a massive skill that every team desires.

### 8. No regrets

Sometimes a trial is the only chance you get to impress selectors and make a team. Make sure you leave the trial without any regrets. Be confident and make the most of it. If you find yourself playing out of position, ask to be given a different role. If you have a particular skill that makes you stand out from the pack, **give yourself an opportunity** to showcase it.

### 9. Know your strengths

Most of the available spots on a team go to players who are:

1.  Reliable all rounders: Grind hard, competent disc skills, rarely turn over.

2.  Valuable outliers: Possess a skill that few others bring to the team (e.g. big in the air, full pitch hucks, insane speed, supreme disc skills)

3.  Occasionally a bit of both

Ask yourself **what you can bring to the team** and which skills you need to display at trials.

### 10. Ask for feedback: Whether you make the team or not

Whether you make the squad or not, you can gain valuable experience from trials and use them as a measuring stick for your level of performance. It’s always good to ask for feedback from the selectors. This can help identify areas of your game to work on and **guide your continued development**.

### Bonus Tip: Have fun!

Enjoy the trial. It’s not an exam or a job interview, it’s just a training session, playing the sport you love, where you get to show everyone what you’ve got. If you’re having fun you’ll:

1.  Stand out

2.  Play your best

3.  Make new friends and hopefully new teammates

Good luck this trial season!
