title: "Injury Prevention and Rehab"
---

Injuries are incredibly frustrating, but they are a normal part of playing competitive sports.

Thankfully, many injuries can be prevented by undertaking an appropriate **strength and conditioning program**, **warming up** properly before training and games, and using **good technique**.

Injuries can be caused by a variety of factors, such as overuse and accidents. They can be painful, hinder your training and stop you from playing tournaments.

Although it is possible to continue playing through minor injuries you should always weigh up the short term benefits against the long term consequences.

Athletic performance is a long term game and it is important to take care of your body. It is usually best to take a few weeks to **rehab** an injury properly than to continue playing. Ultimately, it is your decision to make, but try to put your entire career into perspective when making it.

Continuing to play or failing to rehabilitate an injury can:

-   Make the injury worse.
-   Make the injury take longer to heal.
-   Leave you with lasting damage that affects performance.
-   Increase the risk of future injuries.
-   Reduce the amount of time you can train.

Missing a few training, gym or running sessions to allow you to come back at 100% is better than playing through a season at 80% or playing through pain.

## Dealing with injuries

If you do get injured, **don't ignore it**. If you feel pain, stop what you're doing and rest. Take time to assess the injury properly and decide on your next steps.

Head injuries are especially important to assess. **Concussion** is a serious injury that can have long term consequences. If you suspect you may have a concussion, you should stop playing immediately and seek medical advice. Your teammates and coaches have a responsibility to make sure no one plays on with a suspected concussion. **"If in doubt, sit them out"**.

**Minor injuries** can normally be self-treated with rest, ice, compression, and elevation (**RICE**), especially in the first 48 hours.

For more **serious injuries**, or if pain persists, you should see a **doctor** or **physiotherapist**. They can diagnose the injury and recommend a **treatment plan**.

## Returning from injury

It can be emotionally crushing to stop training or miss tournaments when you're injured. It's important to stay positive and use the **opportunity to come back stronger**. Not being able to play may allow you to spend more time on your strength work or throwing. If you can't perform any physical activity, then perhaps you can gain some experience coaching or analysing games.

When returning from injury, **scale** your training back up slowly. You may need to adjust your training plan to prevent the injury from recurring. Fitness can be regained relatively quickly, don't be tempted to rush back into full training, or "double-up" to catch up on missed sessions.
