title: "Glasgow Ultimate Off-Season Handbook"
---

This handbook is provided by Glasgow Ultimate to help foster player development in the off-season. It contains theory, tips and practical advice to enhance your journey as a player and enable you to think like a coach. After all, the most important coach you will ever have is yourself!

This is not a how-to manual. It is a collection of tips and resources to design your own off-season program. This should begin by identifying specific goals to work towards, outlining the processes required to achieve these goals, and developing a personal plan that fits your lifestyle and motivation.
