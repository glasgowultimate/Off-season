title: "Recovery"

Recovery is an essential part of training. It is during recovery that your body adapts to the stress of training and gets stronger. If you don't recover properly, you won't reap the full benefits of your training.

## Supercompensation

When you train, you stress your body and break down muscle fibers. During recovery, your body repairs the damage and adapts to the stress by building stronger muscles. This process is known as [supercompensation](https://ndmcoaching.co.uk/2019/04/03/applying-the-principle-of-super-compensation/).

The key to supercompensation is to find the right balance between training and recovery. Over-training, or not allowing enough time for recovery between training sessions, can lead to fatigue, decreased performance, and increased risk of injury.

Under-training or leaving too much time between training sessions, minimises the supercompensation effect and can lead to stagnation in performance.

## Recovery methods

Recovering effectively allows you to train harder, train more often, and reduce the risk of injury. There are many ways to recover, and different methods work for different people.

-   **Sleep**: Sleep is the most important part of recovery. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night. If you're training hard, you may need more.
-   **Nutrition**: Eating well and planning your nutrition around your training will aid your recovery.
-   **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to replace fluids lost through athletic effort, flush out toxins and recover faster.
-   **Stretching and mobility**: Stretching can help improve flexibility and reduce muscle soreness.
-   **Ice baths**: Ice baths can help reduce inflammation and muscle soreness.
-   **Active recovery**: Light exercise like walking or swimming can help improve circulation and reduce muscle soreness.
-   **Recovery tools**: Foam rollers, massage guns, compression garments, and TENS machines can help improve recovery.
-   **Meditation and mindfulness**: Meditation or mindfulness practices like deep breathing or visualization can help reduce stress and improve recovery.
-   **Rest**: Sometimes the best recovery is just to rest. Listen to your body and take a day off if you need it.
