title: "Video Analysis"
---

More and more sports teams are turning to video and data analysis to breakdown performance and technique and to study opponents and elite performers.

Watching high-level filmed games is great to analyse team tactics, learn different styles of play and to look at players’ technique. Analysing what makes their movements more effective, we can adjust our play to bring in what we've learnt.\

We can also gain a lot from watching back our own performance.

‘Research shows that on average, athletes and coaches can only recall 30% of performance correctly’ - UK Sports Institute

When playing sport or training, our understanding of what happens is limited to what we perceive is happening and the feedback of our bodily experience. Our perception can be skewed by our mental, emotional and physical state and our physical standpoint in that moment.

When we miss that other 70%, progress can be limited as we can be unaware of unhelpful habits or weaknesses. Or unaware of when we did great things but external factors got in the way.

Using footage can help bridge this gap.

Watching our own performance helps us gain a more rounded view of ourselves as players, based on more objective data.

Before discussing video footage, it’s worth mentioning we can also learn lots from the skills already present in those around us.

**Watch your teammates:**

For that particular element of your game you want to get better at, observe your teammates and see who does it well / better than you.

Ask to spend time throwing / running / doing drills with them. Take note of their technique and ask them questions. Ask them for feedback. Even on a subconscious level, by observing their good technique, you’ll notice yourself mimicking their movements and hopefully improving your technique.

We’ll first look at using footage to analyse team performance, then move on to individual self-analysis.

For both, we gain the most from visual analysis by **being intentional** - by **actively engaging** with what we’re watching, and by making plans on how to apply what we’ve seen to develop our own game. Keep your analysis focused. Discuss it and share it with others. Keep the output limited and applicable.

**Analysing team performance**

Where you can, **watch it together**.Get the squad together and break down a game of Ultimate, either your own or a high-level team’s. By seeing our weaknesses together, reliving our victories, or seeing how to do it even better, the whole team gets on the same page and begins to further align their perspective and intentions.

How can we use footage to develop team performance in Ultimate?

**Watch great Ultimate:**

Watching big athletic plays can be inspirational and get us hyped, but we’ll gain more from breaking down high-level play with good choices, tactics and awareness.

There’s a bunch of links at the end of this document to get you started, including high-level games and analysis resources. 

Try to make your choice of focus specific to your team. What have you noticed your team struggling with? Find games where an alternative is displayed well and break down the elements, e.g. if your team is static and slow fielding the pull, find teams who consistently generate movement and position themselves well off the pull.

Examples of analysis focuses:

-   Try to spot set plays, different structures, the types of zones being used etc. to increase game awareness.

-   Note an offensive set play and analyse in detail. What do they do? If it works, why was it effective? If it doesn’t, what went wrong?

-   Note when the defence comes out with a new tactic - what are they doing? Why are they doing it? Does it create confusion and generate blocks? How does the offence adjust, if at all, and why?

-   Rewind when a player gets a block and see what led up to generating it.

-   Analyse a zone defence/offence point, looking at the team structure as a whole then focusing on each player in turn.

-   When a player is poached, how does the individual react and how does the team utilise them?

-   Analyse the defence in the handler space - what is the force doing? How is the reset defence adjusting?

**Watch your team’s performance in games:**

Personal experiences of games can vary hugely from player to player. Reviewing footage of games with a physically wider perspective and more emotional distance can allow us to gain a more objective and realistic perspective of our performance and more clearly see where improvement is needed.

For example:

-   Analyse a zone defence/offence point. Why was our team’s spacing and positioning (in)effective? Where were the gaps our offence could have exploited and who could have done that? Where were the gaps the offence found and how could our zone have adjusted to shut them down?

-   Follow the progression of your offensive structure for a point. Was it effective? What broke down or what made it work? Is this a recurring pattern? How can it be fixed / what is the key to its continued success?

-   Analyse a false positive (where a poor decision was made but the outcome was good). Unpick what happened and what would have been a better alternative.\

**TASK**: choose a high-level game of Ultimate and analyse it, using a focus from those listed above.

Share on this week’s Spond post what you analysed in 5 or less bullet points, adding how you will use your analysis to inform your training.\

**Self-analysis**

Before going any further, it’s worth noting that the first time seeing footage of yourself running is likely to make you never want to run again. You’re fine. It’s normal.

Video footage can help us track our own progress and development. It can reveal weaknesses in our form, play or decision-making which we might not notice otherwise, allowing us to tailor our training to address these.

The perspective and feedback of coaches is invaluable. But keeping track of a whole team at a tournament or training means their attention cannot be focused on one individual throughout. Using footage can be a way to review our own performance in depth, and your coach may be willing to review footage with you and give more detailed and personalised feedback.

**Watch your own performance in games:**

Again, be focused and intentional in your analysis, keeping the output succinct and applicable. For example:

-   Analyse turnovers. Perhaps it was because of a wonky throw like you thought at the time, or maybe there is a recurring pattern in your decision making or positioning, or maybe the cutters were doing something wacky.

    -   For example, from game footage I found out that I often try to jam throws down the sideline where margins are tight and players are under pressure, when my reset is standing wide open and I haven’t even looked at them. So I’ll aim to be aware of my reset when I pick up the disc and get it to them if they’re free, or engage them earlier in the stall count instead of forcing difficult shots down the sideline.

-   Look for the boring stuff, when you maintained structure or cleared to give others space. Look for when you were out of position and clogged up the throwing lane when you should have set up behind the disc.

**Watch your drills, sprints, lifts and throwing** (But make sure you don’t film anyone without their consent!)**:**

Use the footage to adjust your next rep. Film again and adjust. Repeat.

-   Ask a coach to have a look at the footage and ask for their feedback.

-   Compare your footage to footage of a sportsperson doing the same action. There’s lots of resources on YouTube for sprinting and throwing form.

**TASK:**

Watch footage of your team playing and analyse 5 points when you were on the pitch.

If you don’t have game footage of yourself, film short clips of yourself throwing or lifting.

Pick out two good points and two “room for improvement” points for yourself.

Give timestamps where possible, and suggest better alternatives for the choices you made.

Consider ways to adjust your training going forward to address these improvement points.

Feel free to share this analysis on the Spond post too.
