title: "Mobility Training"
---

Mobility workouts are structured routines aimed at improving the range of motion, control, and flexibility of joints and muscles. Mobility exercises emphasise dynamic, active movements that enhance the functional use of joints and tissues in real-life or sport-specific scenarios.

### Mobility and Functional Strength

Ultimate demands dynamic actions like pivoting, jumping, and lunging, which require both strength and flexibility. Regular mobility training improves joint health, promotes recovery, and ensures that strength gains translate into functional, game-ready movement. Incorporating dynamic stretches, yoga, and targeted mobility drills into your routine will help maintain balance, agility, and control on the field.

Mobility is an essential complement to strength and speed training. Building strong muscles is important, but without the ability to generate power across a full range of motion, you won't fully translate your training into optimal on-field performance. Strength without mobility can lead to stiffness and limited movement patterns, while speed without mobility increases the likelihood of strains during quick directional changes or sprints. Stability and flexibility in the hips, shoulders and knees are especially important for ultimate players to perform complex on-field movements.

Mobility becomes increasingly important as we age. Over time, natural processes such as muscle tightness, joint stiffness, and a decline in flexibility can limit our range of motion and movement efficiency. Regular mobility work helps counteract these effects by keeping joints healthy, improving posture, and maintaining strength through a functional range of motion. Additionally, enhanced mobility supports better balance and coordination, reducing the likelihood of falls and related injuries. Staying mobile also preserves the ability to engage in physical activities and sports, contributing to overall quality of life and longevity.

### Components of mobility workouts

1.  **Dynamic Stretching**: Movements that take joints and muscles through their full range of motion. Examples include leg swings, arm circles, or walking lunges.

2.  **Joint Articulation**: Controlled, isolated movements that improve joint health and awareness, such as shoulder circles or controlled hip rotations.

3.  **Active Flexibility**: Exercises that combine strength and flexibility, like deep squats, where muscles stretch while under load.

4.  **Myofascial Release**: Techniques like foam rolling or using massage balls to relieve tension and improve tissue pliability.

5.  **End-Range Strengthening**: Strengthening exercises at the extreme ranges of motion to improve control, such as Jefferson curls or split squats.

6.  **Balance and Proprioception**: Activities that challenge stability and body awareness, such as single-leg deadlifts or stability ball exercises.

### Goals of mobility training

-   Enhance joint flexibility and stability.

-   Improve movement efficiency.

-   Reduce the risk of injuries.

-   Optimise performance in strength, speed, and agility.  

### Example exercises

-   [**World’s Greatest Stretch**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CiWQ2IvY34): Combines lunging, spinal rotation, and hamstring stretching in a single flow.

-   [**Thoracic Spine Rotations**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHZJns1bXPM): To improve upper back flexibility and rotation for throwing mechanics.

-   [**Ankle Dorsiflexion Stretch**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry3OHAKFMCs): Crucial for cutting and sprinting mechanics.

-   [**Couch Stretch**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9pOjXCKGN8): Focuses on hip flexor mobility for better stride length and core stability.

-   [**90/90 Hip Transitions**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot6EsGs1Wj8): Opens up the hips and improves control over rotational movements.

### More training?

The good thing about mobility training is that you can incorporate it into your existing regime:

-   Add a short mobility routine as a warm up / cool down at the gym

-   Incorporate some mobility exercises into your strength workouts

-   Incorporate exercises into your dynamic warmups before training and games

-   Use mobility training as active recovery. It’s great to keep the body moving on those days where your muscles need some rest.

-   Yoga sessions are a great alternative if you want to try something different

### Test your mobility

The *Functional Movement Screen (FMS)* is a series of tests to evaluate movement patterns and identify imbalances or limitations. It can help you understand your body’s mobility and stability needs, and guide your training to address specific areas.

### Build your mobility routine

Build your own mobility routine that works for you. Think about what you want to maintain and what you want to improve. Start with something that takes around 5 - 10 minutes and is easy to learn, then add exercises from there. There are a lot of exercises and routines to choose from, but these should provide some inspiration.

The [Nike Training Club](https://www.nike.com/gb/ntc-app) app is free and includes many mobility workouts as well as strength, speed and at home workouts.

The [Functional Movement Systems](https://www.functionalmovement.com/) website has a lot of information on mobility and functional movement including a large library of [exercises](https://functionalmovement.com/exercises).
