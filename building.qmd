### Athletic Development

We are going to focus on 4 key areas of physical conditioning for athletic performance:

-   **Strength and Conditioning**

    -   Injury prevention

    -   Improved athletic performance

-   **Endurance training**

    -   Increased stamina to perform for longer and train harder

-   **Speed, agility, quickness (SAQ)**

    -   Increased speed of on-field movements

    -   Avoid injuries and fouls with good footwork and body control

-   **Mobility**

    -   Increased range of motion, maneuverability and flexibility

### Peak Performance

This handbook provides resources for athletic and ultimate conditioning as well as tips and advice to improve other areas of your game:

-   Skill development
-   Nutrition
-   Mental preparation
-   Recovery
-   Video analysis

### Focussing your training

On top of all this training, we also need to spend time playing games and developing strategy and cohesion with our team. Unless you become a full time athlete, it is very difficult to train all of these aspects at the same time.

[Goal setting](goals.html) is one way to focus on the specific elements of training that will benefit you the most. Tailor your training to target key strengths or weaknesses based on your role on a team or the player you want to become.

Another strategy is to adopt a [progressive training plan](planning.html) that changes throughout the season to build towards peak performance.
