### Periodisation

**Periodisation** involves splitting your season into blocks of focused activity in order to **peak** for certain events. Each block is designed around a specific area or progression of your training regime to allow you to reach maximum performance level when it matters most.

There are a couple of great articles on periodisation, phases and ultimate conditioning here:

-   [Periodisation - Peaking at the right time](http://skydmagazine.com/2015/12/periodization/)

-   [The 5 phases of your training year](http://skydmagazine.com/2015/01/five-phases-training-year/)

One typical approach is to break your season down into specific periods, with your training becoming more ultimate specific as you approach your peak. The off-season is great for rehabbing injuries and building strength but eventually we want this gym work to translate to more powerful on field movements: Running faster, turning harder, jumping higher etc.

<br>

| Off season | Pre season | Peak season |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Injury prevention | S&C focus: Power based movements | Maintaining conditioning |
| S&C focus: Strength and robustness | Running focus: Speed and Agility | Competitive play |
| Running focus: Base endurance | Primarily on-field training |  |
| Primarily indoor training |  |  |

### Build A Season Plan

An overall season plan brings your goals into focus and helps you get started with your off-season.

Here is an [example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ni01ex3Xq-TEpTpjfjjTGhxZAcTwUQvEPKZ3FHcb1n0/edit?usp=sharing) of a past season plan. The aim was to develop strength, power and technique through Jan-May, be game ready for the summer and peak for Nationals and Euros at the end of the season.

Some things to think about while creating your plan:

-   Periodisation allows **progressive training**. Build muscle strength, transition this into power and translate that power into on-field movements.

-   **Focus** on specific aspects to maximise gains, rather than spreading yourself too thin.

-   Allow appropriate recovery time between workouts to **avoid overloading**.

-   Make a plan that you can stick to. This needs to be tailored to your own time, motivation and access to facilities.

-   **Avoid plateauing** or **burnout**.

    -   Switching up your routine keeps you **energised, focused and motivated**.

Build your training plan for the upcoming season.

Start by laying out key dates for the year ahead. Think about when you want to hit peak performance, then work backwards to create a plan.

-   Need to perform at trials? Make sure youâ€™ve started running a few weeks in advance.

-   Want to peak for Nationals and again for Euros? Maybe add in a mini off-season to recover and rebuild.
