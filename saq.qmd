title: "Speed, Agility, Quickness (SAQ)"
---

Speed, agility, and quickness are crucial skills for every ultimate athlete, enabling you to sprint, change direction and react to plays on the field.

-   **Speed**: The ability to move rapidly across the ground in a straight line.

-   **Agility**: The capacity to change direction quickly and efficiently while maintaining control. Agility is crucial for sharp directional cuts, defensive adjustments, and avoiding collisions.

-   **Quickness**: The ability to react and move swiftly in short bursts. Quickness determines how fast you can explode off the mark or react to a pass or defender.

## SAQ for Ultimate

Glasgow Ultimate has a [10 week SAQ program](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12OT5balS05hrejnTBiysfwAg2ScNBL3Qtk5-7_pDUfs/edit?usp=sharing) that works on:

-   Acceleration

-   Straight line speed

-   Lateral speed

-   Changes of direction

-   Speed endurance

-   Fundamental footwork patterns

-   Reactive movements

-   Disc skills

SAQ workouts are generally a mix of sprinting, turning and reactive drills. While many of these can be performed in the gym, you may get more benefit from **booting up** and running your workouts on turf. Focus on **game-specific movements,** visualise yourself on the field and **incorporate a disc** to add skill training to your drills.

## Intensity vs volume

Training for speed is completely different to training for endurance. SAQ workouts involve **high intensity efforts** with **long recovery periods.** This is to ensure that each rep is performed as close to your maximum as possible. Try to **avoid fatigue** as this will compromise your form and speed. Quality over quantity is the name of the game when it comes to SAQ.

Ensure you **conduct a warm up** with dynamic stretches and activation drills to perform at your best and avoid injury.

## A note on speed endurance

Speed endurance refers to your capacity to maintain top speed throughout a prolonged sprint or over multiple sprints. The primary focus of a speed endurance workout is to train your **anaerobic** system to resist fatigue. It should not be confused with a cardiovascular endurance workout which trains your **aerobic** system to effectively transport oxygen around your body.

Training the anaerobic system requires **maximal recovery between repetitions**, so speed endurance workouts should be treated like regular speed workouts.

**Aerobic vs anaerobic**

-   Anaerobic (without oxygen) exercise is fueled by energy stored within your muscles.

-   Aerobic (with oxygen) exercise uses oxygen from the air you breathe to create energy.Â 

Your anaerobic system generates energy for short bursts of intense physical activity. The anaerobic system produces energy quickly but is limited by byproducts like lactic acid which cause fatigue and muscle pain.

Your aerobic system generates energy for longer sustained efforts that last more than a few minutes. It uses the heart and lungs to transport oxygen to your muscles.

## When to run your SAQ workouts

SAQ workouts work well in pre-season or during your competitive season for a number of reasons:

-   They build on your off-season strength and conditioning by translating power into explosive game specific movements.

-   The drier and lighter conditions in the spring/summer are often more suited to these types of workouts, especially if performed on grass.

-   They can incorporate sports specific skills and drills which help you reach peak performance at the right time of the season

However, If you are training multiple times a week and playing regularly at weekends, it can be tough to work these in and still give your body adequate recovery periods. Try incorporating SAQ into your **training sessions and warm ups**.

Some athletes like to work on SAQ in the off-season as a way to stay sharp over the winter. There is nothing stopping you from doing this, particularly if this is a weakness you have identified. The off-season is also a great time to work on fundamental movement and footwork to improve the quality of your SAQ workouts later in the season.

## Incorporate reactive drills

Reactive training develops quick decision-making and explosive responses to unpredictable situations:

-   **Mirror drills**: Two players face off. One leads while the other mirrors or reacts to their movements.

-   **Reaction start / change of direction**: React to an auditory or visual cue (like a shout, a raised hand or a flying disc) to sprint or change direction.

-   **Chasing drills**: A defender chases an offense player through a course trying to tag them before they finish.

-   **Disc-based drills:** Adding a catch at the end of a sprint adds a reactionary component to a drill.

## Movement is a skill

When we think about skills we tend to think about complicated actions such as throwing. However, running, turning, jumping and diving are all skills that need to be drilled and perfected by top athletes. Drilling the optimum technique for a 180 degree turn, running sideways or jumping off both feet can be more beneficial than simply trying to perform these actions with more power.

Training fundamental movement patterns is often overlooked by ultimate athletes because most of us have already developed the minimal requirements for coordination, footwork and balance. We tend to skip past developing these skills and focus more on conventional fitness and sports specific training.

Devoting time to perfect your movement patterns will allow you to get the maximum benefit from your SAQ drills. Start slow, use cones and ladders, drill in specific movement patterns the way you would learn to dance. Visual cues can be really helpful, so watch videos or study your teammates and copy the way other players move.
